            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING peruſed your angry Epiſtle, I am now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfied, that after all the clamorous Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and riotous Noiſes againſt my Book of <hi>Church-Power,</hi> raiſed and kept up by Men of your Party and Complexion, and all the endeavours of ſuch Champions as your ſelf, and that renowned Hero the famous Dr. <hi>Burnett,</hi> you have been able to ſay nothing in reply to it, beſides perſonal remarks and accuſations. I might add choice Epithets and embelliſhments of Wit, that might have become a Tripas Exerciſe in the Sophiſter's Schools, but by no means the Gravity of an old exerciſed Maſter of Polemicks. If you can reap any ſatisfaction from loading me with the general Titles of a <hi>Plagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, ridiculous fool, malicious, unskillful maker of Controverſies, a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and rude Diſputer with his Brethren, an accuſer of his Brethren, an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101155:3"/>
implacable man, uncharitable, unjuſt, ſlanderer, proud, void of prudence and common diſcretion,</hi> the uſual Complements you are pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon me, you may be happy in the enjoyment of your humor, though it hath not an <hi>Irenical Complexion:</hi> But I that deſign nothing but the purſuit of Truth and Honeſty, ſhall only endeavour in an eaſie method, and plain words, to come to the true ſtate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between us, and my reply you may be pleaſed to take in this order:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall preſume to make ſome return to thoſe little Pleas and Excuſes that you give in for your ſelf; and thoſe Accuſations of any weight that you are pleaſed to bring in againſt me; and withal take the liberty to reflect a little upon the Treatment I have received from your Friend and Advocate, Dr. <hi>Burnett,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame occaſion: For I foreſee that opportunity will be offer'd.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall make it appear, That the account you give of your <hi>Irenicum</hi> is not fair nor true; and that you conceal your Crime in the very confeſſion of it: The whole deſign and plot being meerly laid againſt the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall enquire more particularly how far you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd, and recanted the principal Errors of it; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Impoſture of your Manuſcript: not doubting to make it appear, That you ſtill owe a publick Recantation for it, not to the poor Vicar of <hi>Coſmus Blene,</hi> but to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall conſider herein the little pleas you make uſe of for your ſelf, and your trifling Accuſations againſt me, together with your Characters of me; and alſo take the liberty of ſome Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi> And here your failure is ſo evident and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious at the very entrance, and your concluſion ſo inconſequential, that it plainly appears you began your Epiſtle in a paſſion, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due conſideration of thoſe things which in courſe follow upon one another. Otherwiſe, how could you ſay to your moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Dioceſan;</hi> That as you <hi>have the ſatisfaction of doing your duty in obeying his Lordſhip's command, for Printing the Sermon you Preached at his laſt ſolemn Ordination, ſo you hope others will have ſo much at leaſt in Reading of it, as to be convinced how unjuſtly you have been, not long ſince, repreſented to the world, as an enemy to the very being of Churches in general, and to the conſtitution of this Church in particular.</hi> Pray
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101155:3"/>
how does it follow, becauſe you Preached ſound and <hi>orthodox</hi> Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at that one time, that you had never Preached or Printed any thing Erroneous or Heretical before? Or what connexion is there in this, <hi>ſuch a one is now a ſound Divine, and therefore he was ſo always?</hi> Had you in that Sermon made it appear that my Accuſation was not True, or that I had ſaid you would never retract thoſe unſound tenents that I accuſed you of, then you might have depended, with ſome tolerable aſſurance, upon the Reader's conviction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice I had done you: But ſince ſo it is, that you neither attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to clear your ſelf concerning thoſe things I accuſed you of; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ſay, you would never retract them; to infer injuſtice on my part, becauſe ſome years after that I had accuſed you, you Preached a Sermon which was <hi>Orthodox</hi> in thoſe points, wherein I ſaid you were once defective, is a concluſion he alone can be guilty of, whoſe common perceptions are choaked with Choler: No Man could ſuſpect that Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> made it, had not the following part of the Epiſtle been of his Compoſure alſo, conſiſting moſtly of the like undecencies. I ſaid you were guilty of ſuch Doctrines at the time when I Printed my Book; but I did not ſay you would never retract them. It was part of my deſign in writing that Book to inform you better, and that you might come to a ſenſe of thoſe Errors, which I apprehended at that time you were not ſenſible of: I told you I judged a retractation neceſſary; and that you ought to make one, (which was my crime in that I ſpake ſo plainly and boldly to you) and no Man rejoyces more, or thanks you more than I do, for what you have performed of that nature in your <hi>Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You argue on at the ſame rate, and ſay, That my <hi>Calumny</hi> (as you are pleaſed to call it) is <hi>groundleſs and ridiculous;</hi> becauſe you have <hi>ſince proved the Church a diſtinct Society, and vindicated her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in general, and the particular conſtitution of this Church.</hi> Now this ſuppoſes the truth of my <hi>accuſation,</hi> and that you once had aſſerted the contrary; only I am ſo diſingenuous that I take no notice of your retractation, but ſtill urge that firſt Error againſt you: and this is the full of all that you can be interpreted to plead for your ſelf. The concluſion indeed ſeems larger upon the firſt reading, by the advantage it hath from the <hi>embelliſhments of your ſtile,</hi> or your artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial diſpoſition of the whole; but he that duly conſiders the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, will find no more: And indeed it is only a <hi>ſham</hi> way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing; juſt as afterwards you tell the Hiſtory of your <hi>Irenicum;</hi> where not one word you ſay comes up to the point under debate. The reality of the Controverſie betwixt us (which you ſay I have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101155:4"/>
with ſo much <hi>folly,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> and <hi>unskilfulneſs</hi> made; and the <hi>world will laugh at me for,</hi> only the comfort is, they muſt firſt diſcern it with your Eyes) lying here; whether you have in your latter Writings given ſufficient evidence to the World of the change of your judgment as to theſe Points of <hi>Church Power in general,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy in particular?</hi> or (as in the words of your <hi>Epiſtle</hi>) you are not ſtill the ſame <hi>Enemy to the very being of Churches in general, and to the conſtitution of this Church in particular,</hi> that I own I once did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent you to be, for which I gave my reaſons in my Book, and private Letter, ſince Printed before it; but never had any Anſwer, unleſs you ſhall be pleaſed to ſay that this <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; (and yet I hear you do ſay ſo) which is indeed a Libel: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it did not come forth until two full Years after. So then, the ground is laid out, and the Controverſie ſtated. You affirm; I deny. I ſhall put it upon a fair Tryal; your own <hi>writings</hi> ſhall be my <hi>Evidence,</hi> and the Readers the <hi>Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You continue on and object, That I <hi>produce not one conſiderable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> which I did not ſteal out of a <hi>Diſcourſe of yours; but this muſt never be taken notice of.</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dean of St. Pauls</hi> have ſufficiently blazon'd me abroad for a <hi>Fool,</hi> and <hi>non-ſenſical fellow;</hi> and truly with reaſon too, if you could prove me ſo <hi>ſilly</hi> as to <hi>ſteal and tell.</hi> When my Papers came firſt to <hi>London,</hi> in order to the <hi>Preſs,</hi> and you, with ſome others, had got them into your hands; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice then uſed, whereby to beſpatter me about the Town, was, to tell it abroad, That I was not the Author of them: And there was, it ſeems, other grounds for it than we were at that time aware of; becauſe they were yours. But when Men are in the Net, the more they ſtruggle, the more they are entangled. I confeſs you owed me a turn; for I had peremptorily accuſed you for ſtealing out of <hi>Robert Parker;</hi> and pointed you to the very <hi>time, Book, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter</hi> and <hi>Margin,</hi> when and where he was tranſcribed by you: And certainly nothing was ever more imprudent, if not unpardonable, than for you to take his credit and teſtimony againſt our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> who profeſſedly deſign'd their defamation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and really was the greateſt Incendiary, and moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, implacable <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> that appear'd in his time againſt us; or perhaps that had appear'd ſince our <hi>Reformation,</hi> excepting <hi>Thomas Cartwright:</hi> A Man could in Conſcience do no leſs than expoſe you for it. And if you had but dealt as candidly with me, and named the particular <hi>time, Book,</hi> &amp;c. your Accuſation would have had greater weight, and my Vindication might have been more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſatisfactory; whereas now I can only proceed upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures.

I remember, once being aſſaulted by an impertinent <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> amongſt other ſtuff, he told me, That <hi>I was a thief;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he gave for it was, becauſe <hi>I ſtole all my Learning from Books.</hi> Now in this ſenſe I confeſs my ſelf a <hi>thief;</hi> and in particular that I <hi>ſtole</hi> my Book out of the <hi>Fathers, Councils, Church-Hiſtory,</hi> &amp;c. and more, that I might poſſibly <hi>ſteal</hi> now and then out of your <hi>Irenicum;</hi> it being ſuch a <hi>Farce</hi> of all manner of <hi>Quotations,</hi> that it is a hard matter to miſs of ſome of them: And I will ſay thus much, That if thoſe <hi>Quotations</hi> were as aptly apply'd as they are numerous, you might, at that time, have been placed in the firſt file of Learned Men. I have been inform'd, That the <hi>Regalia of France,</hi> publiſh'd ſome time ſince by your Friend Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his own name, were the labours and collections of Mr. <hi>Brisbon,</hi> his Country-man, who delivered his Papers unto him, and deſired his judgment of them; but the wiſe <hi>Doctor</hi> (whoſe Back is of <hi>ſteel,</hi> as his Face is of <hi>braſs</hi>) liked them ſo well, that he went <hi>not to bed</hi> till he had tranſcribed them; and immediately Printed them for his own. Now this is <hi>thieving</hi> in our profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Your next Objection is level'd againſt my <hi>ſtile;</hi> that it is without <hi>embelliſhments:</hi> that I follow the <hi>Schoolmen only in Two things,</hi> viz. <hi>A barbarous ſtile, and a rude way of diſputing with my Brethren:</hi> And you engage that <hi>poſterity</hi> will not make me their <hi>pattern:</hi> And Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> has inſiſted on the ſame ſubject before you, with enlargements; and in the cloſe of his Letter, dated <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20. 1684. this is one of the <hi>two ſhort advices</hi> he is ſo kind as to give me; <hi>That if you intend to write any more, you will learn firſt to write true Engliſh, and then to write good ſenſe: but I believe this will prove ſo very hard a task, that the beſt and eaſieſt advice can be given you, is, That you would write none at all.</hi> So that in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> you give me the character <hi>Luther</hi> once gave <hi>Caroloſtadius, viz.</hi> That I have neither Senſe nor Words.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Res &amp; verba Philippus, res ſine verbis Lutherus,</l>
               <l>Verba ſine re Eraſmus, nec res nec verba Caroloſtadius.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As to the former, I have put my ſelf upon my tryal, which is <hi>God and my Country;</hi> only you and Dr. <hi>Burnet are excepted out of the Jury;</hi> becauſe Men ſo notoriouſly incapacitated to be there, through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>intereſt.</hi> As to the latter, I <hi>plead,</hi> in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>guilty;</hi> acknowledging my defect, and that I have been leſs careful and induſtrious therein than I ought, and might have been: And yet I cannot ſay, (under my preſent circumſtances, to be ſure) That I really repent of it; for theſe two Reaſons: 1. Becauſe you had thereby loſt an opportunity of making this Objection againſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101155:5"/>
my <hi>Book,</hi> and ſo much leſs of your Paſſion in oppoſing me muſt have appear'd; which is really my advantage. 2. If my <hi>ſtile</hi> had been agreeable with your <hi>embelliſhments</hi> and ſmoother <hi>polite</hi> phraſes, how can I tell but that you might have taken all my Book away from me; eſpecially ſince you have laid actual claim already to my <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> in particular, I muſt confeſs, That I am no admirer of their Terms and Niceties, yet I cannot condemn all; but (if my little skill in them do not deceive me) their <hi>rude way of diſputing,</hi> ſuch as it is, might become both your own and others imitation: For they are ſeldom guilty of the <hi>embelliſhments</hi> of <hi>ſoul language;</hi> very rarely name perſons, but when the caſe neceſſarily requires it; and avoiding all perſonal heats and quarrels, keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cloſe to their Matter and Argument, but never repute a <hi>nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,</hi> or cramp <hi>Epithete</hi> a Confutation of their Adverſary. And again, I leſs admire your inconſiderateneſs, in that you accuſe ſo eminent an Order of Divines of <hi>rudeneſs in their diſputations,</hi> at the ſame time when you implead me as guilty of the ſame miſdemeanor, in reſpect of your ſelf, and aggravate it againſt me as the greateſt crime. Beſides, you ſeem moſtly peccant herein, having been ſo peculiarly beholden to the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> for your <hi>palmarium argumentum,</hi> or capital Argument (as you call it); for the mixt and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative power of <hi>Biſhops and Presbyters</hi> (for they were the firſt that ſet that deſign on foot; and their Arguments ſtill ſupport it) to which you adhere to this day: Do you not boaſt and value your ſelf upon that one adventure? It appears by the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> that you do; where you tell us, That the deſign of it was, <hi>to gain upon Diſſenters from our Church; and it did not want ſucceſs that way, both here and in a neighbour Kingdom.</hi> (I thought our <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> had never gain'd Proſelytes one and the ſame way.) All that can, with any ſhew, be pleaded for you is, you look'd upon <hi>Peter Lombard</hi> and <hi>Thomas Aquinas, the Maſter of the Sentences, and the Angelical Doctor</hi> to be Country <hi>Vicars,</hi> or to be no <hi>Deans;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelf as under no obligation of gratitude, or common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity towards them for that only reaſon; and hence concluded that you had a right to theirs, equally as to my Arguments; and ſo much the more, becauſe you can put them into better words, your <hi>ſtile</hi> is leſs <hi>barbarous,</hi> or has more <hi>embelliſhments.</hi> And if you hope this way to recommend your ſelf as <hi>a pattern to poſterity</hi> (tho' my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity obliges me to wiſh them better preſidents to copy after) I ſhall not envy your acquiſitions. I aſſure you the bar you have put, that I may not be the like <hi>pattern,</hi> is no ways ingrateful to me. All that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101155:5"/>
I aim at is, to appear to poſterity an honeſt Man in my profeſſion; your <hi>giant</hi> Objection will then be on my ſide. And admit my <hi>ſtile</hi> to be as <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi> as your Eloquence can repreſent it to be, the advantage will be the greater thereby to that truth, which (tho' ſo rudely compoſed) the greateſt Orators have offer'd ſo little againſt. And this point once gain'd, I value no more the repute of a <hi>Grammarian</hi> or Elegant Compoſer, than the <hi>Grammarian</hi> in <hi>Aelian</hi> valued <hi>Helena</hi>'s Picture, that was drawn by <hi>Zeuxes</hi> the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who diſcern'd no one feature in it; being a <hi>Gramarian,</hi> no Limner, as the reaſon is given.</p>
            <p>And yet, if we conſider a little farther, another reaſon may be given for this your <hi>Maſter</hi>-Objection: You were an early Diſciple of <hi>David Blondel</hi>'s, and the reſt of that <hi>Tribe;</hi> who aſſaulted the Epiſtles of the moſt Holy and Primitive <hi>Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> at the ſame rate. And among thoſe many Arguments from whence he concluded them to be ſpurious (wherein you have particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd with him in your <hi>Irenicum;</hi> and I wiſh it were all the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh he bequeathed to you) there are ſome <hi>à dictione petita;</hi> from his unuſual and uncouth ſtile, which he defames and renders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, being unmindful of that of St. <hi>Jerome, Scio inter Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianos verborum vitia non ſolere reprehendi;</hi> as the late moſt Learned <hi>Biſhop of Cheſter</hi> reproves him for it, from the authority of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Father,</hi> in his <hi>Vindiciae Ignatianae.</hi> And <hi>Blondell</hi> is ſo inſolent, and puffed up with a conceit of his ſucceſs herein againſt the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Martyr,</hi> that (in his <hi>Praefatio ad Apologiam pro ſententia Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymi,</hi> pag. 52.) he ſets upon <hi>Franciſcus de Clara</hi> in the ſame way; and concludes himſelf to have baffled his <hi>Apology for Biſhops,</hi> only by giving an account of his <hi>ſoleciſms</hi> in <hi>Grammar,</hi> and other <hi>barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities;</hi> of which I have here given a taſte<note n="*" place="margin">En Barbariſmos, <hi>viz.</hi> Satis teſtium ſunt Zelotes. In recto regiam petierunt Majeſtatem. Veriverbium ſonat. Eccleſiae gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernium. Primitas. Practica Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae. Maxima, id eſt, axioma. Verbulum. Dubiolum vocat, quod poſtea pro grandi objectione habet. Nihil ſanxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt. Epilogat. Amonibiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>: Though I cannot tell whether ſomething elſe might not be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. For <hi>de Clara</hi> writes himſelf <hi>Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum;</hi> which ſounds like a <hi>Vicar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſometimes met with more ſolid and grave Divines (or at leaſt that believ'd themſelves ſuch) who call their Adverſaries <hi>Grammarians;</hi> thereby implying the contempt they had of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as altogether unqualified for thoſe performances in <hi>Divinity,</hi> in which they had engaged themſelves. As I remember, either <hi>Blondell</hi> or <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> or both, thus revile Dr. <hi>Hammond:</hi> But for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101155:6"/>
certain, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> is thus upbraided by <hi>John Milton</hi> (who thought himſelf ſomebody) in his <hi>Pro populo Anglicano defenſio:</hi> as alſo our moſt learned Biſhop <hi>Montacute</hi> by <hi>Labbee,</hi> in his <hi>Diſſertatio Hiſtorica de Scriptoribus Eccleſiaſticis.</hi> But your <hi>greatneſs,</hi> or <hi>Typus Theologicus</hi> takes a contrary method; becomes <hi>Splenetick,</hi> and <hi>ſwells</hi> and inſults over me, with this term of diſgrace, <hi>No Grammarian;</hi> and becauſe I have leſs regarded words and <hi>embelliſhments,</hi> ſince matter of Fact, and Argument, are the only object of my ſearch and enquiry; to which you have not made one exception.</p>
            <p>But my matter is accuſed as <hi>unintelligible;</hi> to which I'll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Anſwer Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> gave for himſelf upon the ſame occaſion, in the <hi>Preface to his Epilogue: The obſcurity of my matter I am not ſorry for; if writing in Engliſh (becauſe here the occaſion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menceth) the reaſons, if the conſequence of it, in ſome matters ſeem ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; I conceive it ought to teach the world, That the People are made parties to thoſe Diſputes, whereof they are not able to be judges: and I am willing to bear the blame of obſcure, if that leſſon may be learned by the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My crime is more heightned yet, in that I am not only <hi>rude with my Brethren,</hi> but with <hi>two Archbiſhops and a Biſhop,</hi> viz. <hi>Whitgift, Bancroft,</hi> and <hi>Bilſon;</hi> whom I remarque for <hi>writing inconſiderately.</hi> I am ſorry that a Man of your Dignity and reputed Learning in the Church, ſhould be brought ſo low, as to ſtand in need of ſuch a palpable Cavil, or groundleſs Accuſation as this is; your caſe ſurely is the ſame with that of a great perſon you elſewhere men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who, <hi>when he had undertaken to manage an ill cauſe before a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick audience, and one of his Friends asked him what he meant by it,</hi> repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Trouble not your ſelf, our own ſide will believe me.</hi> Only ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption could put you upon this particular indictment of me: In plea to which, I will only tell the naked ſtory, and leave the Reader to judge of your candid dealings with me. <hi>Robert Parker</hi> (one that ought not to be named by an honeſt Man but with a mark of infamy) accuſed theſe eminent <hi>Biſhops</hi> for placing the <hi>Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> in the <hi>Prince.</hi> I vindicated them as well as I could, and as I thought, ſatisfactorily. All that I there ſaid of them appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly capable of an exception was, That in laying their Argument, they did not <hi>conſider</hi> that ſo ill-natured a Man as <hi>Parker</hi> might at ſome time or other have advantage againſt them: And I am ſo far from acknowledging it a fault, that I accuſe them of more <hi>inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſs</hi> of the ſame nature, (you may make it their fault if you can) in that they did not foreſee alſo, That ſuch a Book as the <hi>Irenicum</hi> would come into the world; taking occaſion from their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101155:6"/>
writings, and by their authority, to degrade and depoſe them; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly making them a party againſt themſelves, and the inſtitution of their <hi>Epiſcopal Order;</hi> and with as much perverſeneſs and ill nature as ever <hi>Robert Parker</hi> acted againſt them. And now, <hi>you ſee my crime,</hi> it is well if the offence does not lye the other way; in that I made <hi>Parker</hi> appear a defamer: the familiarities one, that I know, once had with his writings, taking them for his own, gives a ſhrewd ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of it.</p>
            <p>Yes, but I lay to their charge the bringing in a new ſort of <hi>Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Hereſie:</hi> which is as new to me, as the name it goes under. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician Hereſie!</hi> I am at a loſs to find who this <hi>Henricius,</hi> or <hi>Henricianus,</hi> the Author of an old Hereſie, is. I have conſulted all my Books, as <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> with others of the Ancients, that wrote of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and particularly the Notes of <hi>Pamelius</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Tertullian's Preſcriptions againſt Hereticks;</hi> where the Catalogue of them is explained; and am ſtill as ignorant as when I firſt ſet out. Who can this <hi>Haereſiarcha</hi> be? I conſider'd a little farther, and the word appearing <hi>Novel,</hi> I conſulted my modern Authors, down to <hi>Edward's Gangraena;</hi> but neither <hi>fell nor fall</hi> appear'd here either. At laſt reading Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Creſſey</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtle Apologetical,</hi> pag. 406. I found the Man, but in great obſcurity, among the mouldy Papers in the <hi>Cottonian Library.</hi> And truly, Sir, tho' I will not preſume to offer to you any advice of my own; yet I will venture to recommend the advice which an excellent Friend of yours gave to me, as he ſuppoſed, in the like caſe; and becauſe I appear'd to him <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible;</hi> it is your <hi>Advocate</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s, in his Letter that he was pleaſed once to write to me, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>You had beſt to do as another Emperor did, write of your ſelf, and illuſtrate your Epiſtle with Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which comes next is a flight of your wit upon the <hi>Vicar of</hi> Coſmus Blene <hi>and the Vicar at</hi> Rome; but falls as much ſhort of it, as <hi>Coſmus Blene</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> are diſtant from one another: But more ill nature accompanies it, (without which ſome have no wit at all) and you inſinuate that to attack you, is to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or at leaſt to be their Friend, as certainly as <hi>the Devil is known by his cloven foot;</hi> for ſo Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> ſpeaks out in his laſt Letter; and farther adds, That we equally degrade <hi>Kings from their Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy,</hi> and at length will make them <hi>Reign at the mercy of the Church, and at the Pope's cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi> was in a heat during the whole time of his <hi>Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing,</hi> and did not conſider immediate conſequences; for he brings <hi>Mr. Dean of St. Paul</hi>'s as evidently into the <hi>praemunire,</hi> as he does me, and accuſes him of the ſame <hi>Popery;</hi> who has declared himſelf to be of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101155:7"/>
my judgment; and that the <hi>Church is a diſtinct Society:</hi> And further, <hi>That I have not produced one conſiderable Argument which he had not made uſe of to that purpoſe, in a Diſcourſe publiſhed above Twenty years ſince.</hi> But if the <hi>Doctor</hi> and the <hi>Dean</hi> have no better Arguments to prove us <hi>Papiſts,</hi> (as we are very well aſſured they have not) we may better bear the charge: I'll add, Or than theſe which are farther produced in the following part of the <hi>Paragraph;</hi> tho' once thought to be very good ones, 'till my great humility, in writing my ſelf <hi>Vicar of Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Blene</hi> better inform'd you. As, Becauſe <hi>I proceed ſo like a judge in Controverſies,</hi> and <hi>after an imperious manner ſummon, by a kind of Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. (It ſeems then, that every judge of Controverſies is a <hi>Pope,</hi> and each Citation is a <hi>Bull from Rome</hi>) or elſe, that my private Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, begging a more full information from your own hand, (for that was all which I deſired of you in my Letter) is of the ſame nature as a <hi>Summons</hi> or <hi>Citation</hi> from the <hi>Courts Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> and you ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt an Anſwer to it, had been a declining your <hi>Dioceſan's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Juriſdiction.</hi> One of theſe, or all you muſt be interpreted to mean, if you mean any thing; and chooſe whether you pleaſe, it is pure <hi>Irenicum</hi> all over, or the very <hi>Weapon-ſalve</hi> Doctrine and Argumentation. Thus Men uſually run into the contrary extream, thinking thereby to <hi>atone</hi> for the firſt Error. And you who have before aſſerted your Biſhop to be really void of Power, or a mere name without Authority; now enlarge his Power as much too far, and make it a breach of <hi>Canonical Obedience,</hi> to Write, or Anſwer a Private Letter, without his knowledge and Licence.</p>
            <p>However, notwithſtanding the danger of <hi>Popery,</hi> (for you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſay again, That <hi>I proceed like a judge of Controverſies, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you after an imperious manner by a kind of Citation,</hi> and you may as well ſay ſo now, as before) I'll venture to ask you Two Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more: 1. Where the crime really lyes in <hi>proceeding like a judge of Controverſies?</hi> does not every one that writes of <hi>Controverſies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>judge</hi> of them? he ought to be ſo; or elſe he ought not to write about them. And if you had laid your calumny here, That I am not fit to write Controverſies, but undertake to be a judge when I am not qualified for one, and proved it, you had done ſomething more than every Traducer can do. Your Objection ſeems co-inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s, in his rude Letter, which he ſent me, <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 20. 1684. <hi>Becauſe I publiſhed my Book after a courſe of ſtudies, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on full thoughts, and a thorow conſideration;</hi> or that I did not Print it, as he does <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> without fear or wit: or as he did his Letters in their defence; with ſuch raſh, heady precipitancie, that he is forced to retract in one, what he wrote in another; and each contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101155:7"/>
the other; as will appear in due place. 2. Admit that I had ſent you a <hi>ſummons</hi> by <hi>citation</hi> to Anſwer ſuch Queſtions as I ſhould demand of you, ſuppoſing you in great Errors, and the Church of God had received great damages by your publication of them; you of all Men ought to have taken the leaſt exceptions againſt me for it, who in your <hi>Irenicum</hi> have enſtated me, as a Presbyter, and by virtue of my Orders, in full power for the doing of it; as to <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend, inſpect, preſide over,</hi> and <hi>govern the Churches;</hi> and from the beſt authority and precedents <hi>Eccleſiaſtical.</hi> So that if I had tranſgreſſed, ſince Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> led me to it, he need not have been ſo very harſh and ſevere upon me for it: Eſpecially, ſince the utmoſt of my crime can amount no higher, than that it was done <hi>unclaſſically.</hi> I'll only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat your own Words for my authority; <hi>Irenic. pag.</hi> 355. <q>That they (<hi>viz.</hi> the Presbyters) concurred in governing the Church, and not only by their Council but Authority, appears from the general ſence of the Church of God, even when Epiſcopacy was at the higheſt. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaking of the Office of Presbyters, <gap reason="foreign">

And conſequently, upon your own terms, the <hi>lofty Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of Coſmus Blene</hi> went not beyond his commiſſion, if it were true (as you ſcandalize him) that he did actually Summon and Cite you, in order to a <hi>recantation</hi> of <hi>your Error,</hi> as <hi>publickly,</hi> as the <hi>error, ſcandal, and offence given by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Character you affix upon me is not ſo eaſily to be born, or pardon'd; <hi>[This accuſer of his Brethren]</hi> becauſe the character which is given to the Devil, <hi>Rev.</hi> xij. 10. and you repeat it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>[as my accuſer calls it.]</hi> I have made a very ſtrict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my ſelf in that performance, and cannot find that I have given any occaſion why you ſhould expoſe me to mankind under ſo odious

a Character. I am ſo confident of my Innocency, that, in order to my Vindication, I'll here alſo tell the naked Story, and make my Enemies my Judges. Sixteen years after the firſt publication of your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> (for which, as you ſay well, many Men <hi>made allowance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſcepticalneſs and injudiciouſneſs of Youth, and the prejudices of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>) the Manuſcript that is there, and the moſt Scandalous part of it, (made more Scandalous, by your declaring it to be the Senſe of our Church) was reprinted, with your order, in <hi>Doctor Burnet's Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> as an <hi>authentick Record;</hi> and with the Approbation of <hi>both Houſes of Parliament</hi> (by the undue procurement of your Party) affixed unto it, which, by the way, you have declared to be the Mouth of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And this was done without any caution or alteration, excepting for the worſe; becauſe concealing <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s (probable at leaſt,) <hi>Retractation.</hi> And about this time alſo <hi>Mr. Dean of Canterbury</hi> Preached before the <hi>Court,</hi> and afterward Printed Doctrines to the ſame purpoſe, or rather more offenſive. Hereupon I apprehended a farther deſign, than many were aware off; and not without Reaſon: For what, appearingly, adds more to the confirmation of theſe Doctrines, as the Senſe of our Church, than the approbation of both <hi>Houſes of Parliament,</hi> and the popular names of Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> and all this might make a greater impreſſion upon me, than on ſome others; becauſe I had for many years applied my Studies to ſearch after the <hi>Rights of the Church,</hi> and that Power which our <hi>Saviour</hi> had veſted her withal, and appointed to be continued till his coming again: Eſpecially, I being not in the number of thoſe <hi>Subſcribers,</hi> who believe themſelves no ways obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to defend what they have <hi>aſſented and conſented unto.</hi> I therefore reviſed my <hi>Collections,</hi> and digeſted them in that order, according to which they have ſince been Printed: where, as I make ſome reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon you, ſo I always refer to your own Words and Senſe to vouch them. And yet when my Papers came to <hi>London,</hi> all the Objections that I found to be made againſt them by ſome Learned Men, into whoſe hands they lighted, were occaſion'd by reaſon of your ſelf, and <hi>Doctor Tillotſon;</hi> on whom I ſeemed, in their Eyes, to reflect over-ſeverely. Hereupon I wrote a private Letter to you, (ſince Printed before my Book) the ſumm of which, is, to tell you the ground of that Charge I had laid againſt you, and that I conceiv'd Poſterity would be concerned by reaſon of your Writings in this Cauſe, (not in my Writings, as you are pleaſed to miſreport me) if no Publick acknowledgment of the error be made by you; further adding and deſiring, that you would inform me wherein I had wrongfully accuſed you; engaging, upon due notice, that I would expunge whatever
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101155:8"/>
was in my Papers, relating that way. To this you vouchſafed me no Anſwer, unleſs Scorn and Contempt (enough of which came abroad every day) are to be reputed one; or the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> publiſhed two years after; which is only a <hi>Defamatory Libel.</hi> And now I appeal to the whole World, Whether there is any thing in all this on my part that is <hi>Diabolical;</hi> or that may fix upon me the Character of <hi>ACC<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SER,</hi> in Capital Letters? As alſo how unjuſtly you have farther ſlander'd me, with the <hi>Epithets</hi> of <hi>Implacable, Whom no recantation will do good, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable &amp;c.?</hi> or wherein any <hi>publick ſcandal or offence is given by me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Scandal and offence</hi> be laid here, (and ſome have ſo laid it) as expoſing our own Members to the ſcorn of the common Adverſary, eſpecially in theſe divided times: Or if it be farther pleaded, That ſince our <hi>Church</hi> is well known, to have neither publiſhed nor counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced any ſuch Doctrines in her <hi>Articles, Homilies, Canons, Rubricks, &amp;c.</hi> it had been much better and ſafer, to have paſſed over, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſome few, tho' <hi>heterodox</hi> Opinions of one or more particular Doctors, which cannot be ſuppoſed to influence and debauch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, againſt the judgment of a whole Church to the contrary. To this I anſwer. Thoſe always have been obſerved as the worſt of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that ariſe among our ſelves, and within the Bowels of a particular <hi>Church:</hi> and they have the greateſt advantage to delude and ſeduce. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore gives Directions for ſevere proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt thoſe that are <hi>within,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and by the parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Rule is to extend to other offenders, than thoſe there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by him. And as to my own particular, I do here produce theſe following inſtances, whereby it will appear, that other Writers have taken the ſame courſe and method before me.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> ſhall be the firſt, in <hi>his General Preface to an Anſwer to ſeveral late Treatiſes,</hi> &amp;c. The learned Doctor having at large diſcovered ſeveral corruptions among the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> and more particularly in the point of <hi>Repentance;</hi> they endeavor to clear the honour of their <hi>Church,</hi> and thus argue: <q>That where the Church hath defined nothing in her Councils, it is to no purpoſe to object that ſuch Doctrines are taught in it; for thoſe who defend their Separation from the Communion of a Church, by reaſon of its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and Erroneous Doctrines, muſt make it appear thoſe are taught by it, and the belief of them alſo exacted by its ſubjects.</q> To whom he thus replies: <q>But ſuppoſing there were no ſuch foundation for this Doctrine in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as we ſee there is, would there be no danger to Men's Salvation, if their Confeſſors generally told them theſe things, and they knew it to be the general Opinion among them? Is there no <hi>danger of falling into the Ditch when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101155:9"/>
the blind lead the blind,</hi> unleſs a General Council expreſly allow of it? Is there no danger of <hi>Empiricks</hi> and <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> unleſs the whole <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> approve them? And then he adds farther: I confeſs when we debate the cauſes of ſeparation from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, we think it then reaſonable to alledge no more than what they impoſe on all to believe and practiſe (and we have enough of all Conſcience without going any farther;) but when we preſent the hazard of Salvation to particular Perſons, we may then juſtly charge them with pernicious Doctrines and Practices, which are received and allow'd among them, although not decreed by the Church in Councils. For otherwiſe it would be juſt as if one ſhould ſay to a Man, that asked him whether he might ſafely Travel through ſuch a Country? <hi>Yes, without doubt you may; for although there be abundance of Thieves and High-way Men, yet the Prince or the State never approved them, nor gave them liberty to rob Travellers.</hi> Do you think any Man would venture his Perſon or his Purſe on no better ſecurity? yet ſuch ſecurity is all they can give, as to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; for they dare not deny the bad conſequence of the Doctrines and Practices charged upon them, but only ſay, The Church hath not decreed them.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When <hi>Doctor Jeremy Taylor</hi> publiſhed ſome Tenents concerning <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which oppoſed the Doctrine of our <hi>Church; Doctor War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Lord Biſhop of Rocheſter,</hi> wrote a Treatiſe againſt him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected his error as openly as he had divulged it. A great deal might have been pleaded in the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s behalf; as much, nay, more than can be pleaded for any Man now a days; ſuch was his eminency in all Learning, his great and daily ſervice for the Church in her preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, he ſtanding almoſt alone in the gap, and in oppoſition to her many Enemies ready to devour her, and ſtill gaping with their Mouths upon her: She was at a very low Ebb, and the Channels were ſeen at God's chiding, at the rebuke of the blaſt of his Diſpleaſure. But none of theſe things moved the excellent <hi>Biſhop,</hi> or diverted his purpoſe. He knew full well, that ſuch breaches were advantageous to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy; and therefore the healing them by due Argument and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, was the only way to ſtop their Mouths. And I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, thoſe few Biſhops ſurviving in that diſmal overthrow of our Church, Summon'd the <hi>Doctor</hi> to the houſe of <hi>Doctor Duppa,</hi> at <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> who was then Lord <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> where he ſubmitted, and made his acknowledgment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When ſome <hi>Puritanes</hi> at <hi>Frankford,</hi> had oppoſed the Government and <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and ſet up their own in its room; <hi>Doctor Cox</hi> firſt, and then Dr. <hi>Horn,</hi> undertook them; notwithſtanding they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101155:9"/>
were little better than baniſhed Men, and the <hi>Marian</hi> Perſecution raged at home, which made <hi>England</hi> too hot for them all. No pleas of Peace and Unity ought to prevail for the complying with, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing thoſe who oppoſe the received Doctrines, and Conſtitutions of that Church, whereof they are Members; every good and knowing Man will <hi>withſtand ſuch to the face,</hi> although they do in many things unite with him againſt the common Adverſary. And thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the nature and conſtitution of the Church of <hi>Chriſt, as a diſtinct Society,</hi> and its obligations upon Chriſtians, believe alſo its Laws, equally eſtabliſhed and binding, when the <hi>Secular Power</hi> frowns upon and diſowns her, as when it maintains and protects her: and that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in all things</hi> (as you are pleaſed to expreſs it) or a <hi>Laxation</hi> of outward reward or penalties, <hi>gives no liberty to any one man to chooſe his own way;</hi> but much leſs does it authorize and indemnifie any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Doctor,</hi> or more, to draw up new <hi>Schemes</hi> and <hi>Modes</hi> of <hi>Worſhip;</hi> or make <hi>eaſier Terms than were before required, for the bringing Men in unto them.</hi> Under theſe circumſtances Diſſenters are leaſt of all to be born with, and tenderneſs towards them is to have no place. And it is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly obſerved by the Author of <hi>Religion and Loyalty,</hi> Part 1. p. 566. that under the Reign of <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> more ſtrictly united than ſhe had done before, in executing her Diſcipline, and that power which Chriſt had enſtated on her; ſhe then <hi>put an end to the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious</hi> Arian <hi>Controverſie, eſtabliſhed the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith over all the Chriſtian World, and prevented new Schiſms and Factions, that were at that time break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in the Christian World.</hi> And then to be ſure the <hi>Euſebian Latitude-Trimmers</hi> had no favour ſhewed them, becauſe of the preſent <hi>Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Romiſh Doctors</hi> themſelves gave us theſe like inſtances; and the moſt ſober of them do not think, that their Unity (in which they ſo much boaſt) is violated, or any occaſion of Scandal and Offence given to thoſe which <hi>are without,</hi> in that the errors of particular <hi>Doctors</hi> (tho' otherwiſe deſerving from their Church) are openly taken notice of and refuted; but, on the other hand, conclude ſuch proceedings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and uſeful for the preſerving their Faith laudable in the unity and peace of it. It is but the other day that Mr. <hi>White,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> (who are known to have been great Zealots for <hi>Rome,</hi> in this Kingdom) publiſhed ſome Tenents injurious (as it was thought) to the <hi>Romiſh Faith;</hi> for this they were ſeverely cenſured, and a Book came out againſt them, <hi>Autore M. Lomino Theologo,</hi> Printed at <hi>Gaunt,</hi> 1675. whoſe Title is, <hi>Blackloanae Haereſis Hiſtoria &amp; Confutatio,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Blacklo,</hi> a name by which <hi>White</hi> uſed, ſometimes, to be called. Upon this Publication, the <hi>Blackloists</hi> made great clamors, and not only they, but the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> at large, and who were not engaged in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101155:10"/>
Controverſie: As, That theſe were not times for <hi>Catholicks</hi> to write one againſt another, admoniſhing, that, <hi>Tempori ac Haereſi cedendum,</hi> way is to be given to the <hi>Time and the Hereſie</hi> together; the danger of <hi>Schiſm</hi> is now hanging over our heads, and that the <hi>Orthodox</hi> will be hereby laugh'd at by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> becauſe diſagreeing. To whom <hi>Lominus, in his Preface,</hi> gives this anſwer, which being of ſo full weight, and able to ſatisfie any Man in this or the like caſe, I will here Tranſcribe; thus Tranſlated.</p>

                        <p>I much lament this only refuge of the <hi>Blackloiſts</hi> (as the laſt groan of a dying ſect, thereby to move pity from imprudent People) is heard ſo patiently. Is it ſo then? are the errors of the Novelliſts to be neither detected nor condemned, leſt that Hereticks may take a Phariſaical Scandal, and thoſe that are unskilful ſay, The Church will be divided by reaſon of the cenſure of Hereſies? To what purpoſe then hath the Lord placed Watch-men upon the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſhall not hold their peace day nor night? For what uſe are the Biſhops and Paſtors, unleſs to withſtand Hereſie and watch over the Flock; as thoſe that are to give an account of the Souls commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them? If there muſt be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, it is fit that the oppugners of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies in the Church do not hold their Tongues. Shall it be lawful for <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas White</hi> and <hi>John Sargent</hi> to pull in pieces the Foundations of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, and ſhall it not be lawful for <hi>George Leyburn,</hi> and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to reprove theſe Writers and their Abetters, and to warn believers, that they take heed to themſelves, by reaſon of Wolves in Sheeps clothing? That eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Church, <hi>Jerome,</hi> doth witneſs, that daily Schiſms at length
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101155:10"/>
turn into Hereſie: But none that is Orthodox, hath ſaid, that Schiſms are produced by the detection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of Hereſies. The unity of the Catholick Faith, and cloſe joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of the Body of the Church and its integrity, doth not conſist in this, That none fall from the Faith, or none teach Hereſie; but herein eſpecially, That the Fall be not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or that their corrupted Doctrine be not confounded with the ſound; a rotten Member ought to be cut off, rather than the Body be deſtroyed; let then the Innovator go out, and be expelled from us, though heretofore he was ours. I know it is moſtly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Chriſtian Faith, that we nouriſh the weak in the Faith; but it is no ways contrary to Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but every ways conforming, that we ſtrike with the Pen and Cenſures, ſuch as are Strangers to the Faith. And therefore the Biſhops, and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Apoſtles, have alſo a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral Staff committed unto them. When the Church uſes the Staff and the Pen againſt Hereticks, the Faith is one and ſound; neither ought the Ears of the Faithful to be ſo delicate, as to be offended with the ſound and noiſe of thoſe that diſpute againſt Hereſies coming in upon us; we are in the Tents of the Church militant, and that Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is deſervedly laught at, who not enduring the noiſe of Armes, fears the provocations of Battels of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

            <p>But why ſhould I wonder at your dealings with me, ſince you are ſo bold with the beſt of <hi>Kings</hi> and Men? I mean <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> and the <hi>Martyr;</hi> whom you hale in as a Party to that moſt falſe Aſſertion,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101155:11"/>
which he always oppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> That, <hi>the Form of Church-Government is mutable:</hi> Or that, <hi>there is no certain Form of Government preſcribed in the Word.</hi> It is the leaſt that he meant by thoſe Words, that you take the confidence to produce, or that any Man can interpret him to have meant by them; and this will appear all along in his ſeveral Writings, and Declarations of his Judgment in the point. I will at preſent, for evidence of it, confine my ſelf to his <hi>Majeſty's final anſwer concerning E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, deliverd in to the Commiſſioners of Parliament, the firſt of Novemb.</hi> 1648. where he contends for the <hi>Immutability</hi> of the two Orders of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to whom he aſſigns diſtinct, appropriated, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable Offices and Acts; and bottoms it, firſt, upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and then upon this very <hi>Apostolical primitive Practice</hi> (which you ſay he recommended only as a decent rule to your Arbitrary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellers of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> to be followed by them, as they ſhall be pleaſed) reſolving in his own practice never to vary from it: Or in the true application of your Words, <hi>Whoſe ſufferings could never make him warp from what his judgment directed.</hi> And the injury you have done to his <hi>Sacred</hi> Memory and Reputation (as alſo to the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) will be farther notorious to him that conſults the Twelfth and laſt Chapter of his <hi>Royal</hi> anſwer; where he tells the Commiſſioners, That, <hi>until one of theſe three things can be clearly evidenced unto him,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Either that there is no certain Form of Church-Government preſcribed in the Word; or, If there be, that the Civil Power may change the ſame as they ſee cauſe; or, If it be unchangeable, that it was not Epiſcopal, but ſome other; he thinks himſelf excuſable in the judgment of all reaſonable Men, if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not as yet be induced to the utter aboliſhment of that Government in the Church, which he found here ſetled to his hands, which hath continued all over the Chriſtian World, from the times of the Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. Now, his Majeſty never did receive any ſatisfaction from them in any of theſe three things, as he farther declares, and thereupon complains of their <hi>ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unwillingneſs to diſcover their minds in a matter of ſo great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence:</hi> And therefore, he cannot be conceived to have allowed <hi>Church-Government</hi> to be <hi>changeable;</hi> or that <hi>Humane,</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence</hi> hath any thing to do in the erecting or aboliſhing of any one ſort of it, as Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> repreſents him to have done. Some <hi>modes</hi> in the execution might, but the two orders did not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>time</hi> and <hi>circumſtances,</hi> in the opinion of this wiſe <hi>King,</hi> and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Martyr.</hi> I confeſs, how it would have fared with his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> as to theſe points, if the great boldneſs and reſolution, which ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in our <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> had been in the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> tho in a leſſer meaſure, is uncertain. Or had Providence ſo order'd it, that himſelf in perſon had been in <hi>Commiſſion</hi> with them, Who knows but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101155:11"/>
that he might have made a Convert of his Majeſty, and become thereby an happy inſtrument in preventing the moſt horrid of Murthers, which was, within a very little while after, committed upon him: For in all likelihood, if the <hi>King</hi> would have ſubmitted in any one of the forementioned points, the Scandal and Diſhonour in cutting off his Head, had never fall'n upon theſe three, thereby moſt unfortunate, <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> It is certain, that he oppoſed the <hi>change</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as in the <hi>State,</hi> with his laſt Blood. But I ſhall have another opportunity to inſiſt more at large on theſe things, in my Vindication of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the moſt eminent <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> of our Church, whom he hath defamed all at once, in that laſt Chapter of his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> which I intend to make publick in a little time, if God give me Health, and my Superiors give me leave, and therefore ſhall forbear at preſent. I'll only add,</p>
            <p>That ſince you have dealt thus familiarly and plainly with a <hi>King,</hi> and profeſs to have aſſumed your errors from him, I hope your Friend <hi>Doctor Burnet</hi> will not fall foul upon me any more, for want of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> or for being <hi>over-lofty;</hi> becauſe I once <hi>borrowed a Figure from a Crowned Head,</hi> and applyed to my ſelf an inſtance of Policy, that a <hi>King of Iſrael</hi> once uſed. A crime which I do not think ſo great (in any other eye, but the worthy <hi>Doctor</hi>'s,) as to need a <hi>purgation,</hi> tho' he urgeth it over and over in his <hi>Letters.</hi> It is our Duty to imitate the <hi>King of Kings</hi> in Heaven; and there is ſomething in his <hi>Vicegerents</hi> on Earth, which may become our imitation alſo. It is true, that ſome attributes in God are incommunicable, and unimitable; to attempt them is the height of preſumption: and ſo have Kings their <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> which no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can copy out but by <hi>Invaſion:</hi> And yet the Divinity is again imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in other <hi>attributes,</hi> and ſo are Kings too, in many of their <hi>Perfections;</hi> and in none more than in their common rules of Policy and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in thoſe advices of the like nature with this which was given to King <hi>Saul, viz.</hi> That he would not imploy his Strength againſt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> who was already at his Footſtool; or attempt a Victory by which no advantage could return to him. But it is very uſual with a ſort of Men, to make ſhews and jealouſies for ſome things, as the <hi>incloſures</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> which are not really ſuch, or bring no benefit and ſecurity unto them: And again, on the other hand, tread upon that which is really ſacred and ſeparate; when they'll inrode and invade without any ſcruple their <hi>Crowns, Dignities</hi> and <hi>Prerogatives.</hi> There are a ſort of Men, who ſtart at the biting of a Flea upon a King's hand, and with no concern pour out his Blood upon the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> They come too near <hi>Kings,</hi> that do it without a <hi>Figure,</hi> who ſtain their <hi>ſacred</hi> Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by imputing to them their groſſer Errors; who aſſault their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101155:12"/>
               <hi>Guards,</hi> and confine their Perſons, or lead up a <hi>Field Conventicle</hi> againſt them. It was one of the uſual Aphoriſms of <hi>King James the Firſt,</hi> of bleſſed Memory: <hi>God keep me from my Friends, and I know how to keep my ſelf from my Enemies.</hi> If the <hi>Doctor</hi> pleaſe he may ſay again, <hi>The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is ſomewhat extraordinary:</hi> But nevertheleſs I have made it to my ſelf; and do declare, That I have imitated both the Warlike <hi>King of Iſrael,</hi> and the Wiſe <hi>King of England;</hi> and it was part of my deſign in publiſhing my <hi>Diſcourſe of Church Power</hi> (which is the very bottom of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s courſe Behaviour towards me) to give caution to the People of <hi>England,</hi> that they beware of their <hi>Friends: i. e.</hi> a ſort of People within our ſelves, who <hi>go to the Houſe of God with them as Friends,</hi> but betray and give up the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of the Church of God to the will of its Enemies; and if they'll do this, they need not fear what their Enemies can do unto them. And I am certain withal, that, that Wiſe <hi>Prince,</hi> if he were again among us, would account me neither <hi>immodest</hi> nor <hi>lofty,</hi> for imitating his Prudence, and uſing his <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi> But if my <hi>Figure</hi> be too <hi>lofty,</hi> and <hi>Application extraordinary,</hi> in comparing my ſelf to <hi>Kings, Doctor Burnet</hi>'s <hi>Figure</hi> is as much too low and mean on the other hand, when he compares the <hi>King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to a <hi>Poſtillion;</hi> for ſo he calls <hi>Henry VIII. The Poſtillion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> and concludes the Character to befit him too, in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation, &amp;c.</hi> Surely, however, the <hi>waxed Boots and oyled Coat</hi> became <hi>Luther,</hi> or whoever it was repreſented him in them, they are Robes no ways becoming that great and magnificent <hi>King:</hi> Beſides, not only the dignity of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> but the merit of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> is much abated and diminiſhed thereby. The <hi>Poſtillion</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together at the direction, and under the diſcipline of one in the Box, who commands with a Laſh in his hand, and is really his <hi>Auriga, Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernator,</hi> ſits at the Helm and governs him: And if you had called this great <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Coachman of the Reformation,</hi> the Metaphor had been much more apt, and agreeable. And the reaſon of the Figure fails alſo; for, the <hi>Reformation</hi> was not managed at the rate, and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as when Men ride <hi>through thick and thin:</hi> That ſuits a <hi>Deſperado</hi> much better, and deſcribes one that makes <hi>ſtrength the Law of Juſtice,</hi> and regards neither <hi>right</hi> nor <hi>wrong;</hi> but the aim of the <hi>Reformation</hi> was, to remove the filth and mire, and purge it away, by caſting off the <hi>Pope's Supremacy,</hi> and other encroachments; and to re-aſſume that ſupreme Right of our <hi>Kings,</hi> annexed by the anteceding Laws of our Land to their <hi>Crown Imperial.</hi> And ſince he has lighted on ſo unſeemly a Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, taken from the <hi>puddle,</hi> the <hi>Scavinger</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> had been a more apt and proper <hi>Epithete.</hi> Furthermore, I will appeal to the whole World, whether it be not more pardonable to imitate a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101155:12"/>
King in his laudable Actions and Policies, performable by him as a Man, than to reſemble him to ſo baſe and abject a perſon, as a <hi>Poſtillion</hi> is known to be. The <hi>Doctor</hi> very well knows, that this is one rule always to be obſerved in taking a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> That it be not from any thing filthy or ſordid, eſpecially when the Tranſlation is to Kings; and it is very much to his diſrepute, that he who values himſelf at ſo great a rate for his <hi>stile and oratory,</hi> ſhould ſo groſly fail in the common and known rule of a <hi>Similitude.</hi> And yet I will not be over raſh, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all to his miſtake. The intimacy that he ſays he had with Mr. <hi>William Petit, Councellor of the Inner-Temple;</hi> and that he had his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and Directions, as to the <hi>Laws and Cuſtoms of this Nation,</hi> in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> give ſome ſuſpicion, that he might have no very high thoughts of our <hi>Kings.</hi> Mr. <hi>Petit</hi>'s late Printed Book indicates too much of his Temper, and his choice of <hi>Doctor Burnet;</hi> for the digeſting and publiſhing his <hi>Collections,</hi> argue too much of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Bunnet</hi>'s alſo; and there's no queſtion to be made, but that they conſulted together, as, in order to the compoſing of the <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation of the Church,</hi> ſo, for the writing of that <hi>History of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Kings,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Petit</hi> a little after publiſhed under the Title of, <hi>The Ancient Rights of the Commons of England,</hi> &amp;c. in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to which, he delivers this as an undoubted and <hi>authentique</hi> ſtory. <hi>Apud Britannos populus magna ex parte principatum tenet,</hi> pag. 4. and pag. 6. <hi>De minoribus rebus principes conſultant, de majoribus omnes. Among the Britains, the People have the Government for the moſt part. The [Princes] conſult concerning the leſſer things, but [All] concerning the greater.</hi> And further ſays, That <hi>Parliaments were inſtituted to hear and determine the Complaints, and the wrongful Acts of the King, the Queen, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Now all this very well agrees with the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of the <hi>Poſtillion;</hi> and we may alſo hence conclude, That it was not from the <hi>Doctor's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government,</hi> but ſome other particular intereſt (which is eaſily diſcerned) that he publickly declared at the <hi>King's-Bench in West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall,</hi> He did not believe that part of the late moſt helliſh Plot, againſt the Perſon and Dignities of our late <hi>Sovereign King Charles II.</hi> of bleſſed Memory, which was laid for ſeizing his Perſon, and giving him only ſome due Chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>Your diſingenuity to your Superiors in the Church, is as great as your injuſtice to <hi>King Charles the Firſt:</hi> of which an higher inſtance cannot be given, than to repreſent them as Patrons to your Errors, becauſe they have been civil to your Perſon. There is, I ſee, great care to be taken of treating ſome Men with common <hi>kindneſs:</hi> And the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeems more particularly unbecoming thoſe of your Complexion, or <hi>Moderation;</hi> whoſe <hi>temperamentum ad pondus,</hi> or juſt mixture, conſiſts
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101155:13"/>
in this, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>indulge</hi> every Man in his particular judgment, and treat him with a fair converſe, when retaining quite different <hi>ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> from him. And I am very confident that your ſelf will take it very ill from that Man which ſhall call you <hi>Phanatick,</hi> becauſe you have <hi>trimmed</hi> for them, and drawn up a <hi>ſcheme of comprehenſion,</hi> and had ſo frequent meetings with them at <hi>Doctor Burton</hi>'s <hi>Chamber.</hi> Beſides, the grand Caſe at the <hi>King's Bench-Bar at Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, has made it fully appear, That a Man may be under a heavy guilt, and yet, ſuch be the circumſtances as to <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> that his <hi>Superiors</hi> cannot, with prudence, call him to an account, and retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him his condign puniſhment; nay farther, ſo hard may the neceſſity be, as to enforce from them a civil treat, and with more eſpecial <hi>kindneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You plead, That <hi>before the Church was re-eſtabliſhed,</hi> you received <hi>Epiſcopal Orders from an excellent Biſhop of this Church:</hi> which may be true; and I queſtion not but that it is: But it is no proof that you were then an <hi>Epiſcopal Divine.</hi> Several in thoſe days took that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent way, upon this conſideration; becauſe, tho' ſome denied a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> to be a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> yet all own'd a <hi>Biſhop</hi> to be a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt accept of your <hi>Ordination:</hi> The <hi>divine appropriated Right of the Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>ſingular Power,</hi> enſtated on him by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> might not be conſidered by you in that action.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place; you are very unjuſt to me, in adding to all your other Calumnies, this one, <hi>viz.</hi> That I am therefore ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> unto you, and enhaunſe your ſuppoſed crime, becauſe an <hi>Offender my ſelf; as if it were ſome atonement for my own miſcarriages, to be always finding fault with my Brethren.</hi> And tho' this Scandal be of leſs concern to the publick, than thoſe other which you laid upon the <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> and your <hi>Church Governors;</hi> yet it is every way as groundleſs and falſe. Whatever my other failings have been; yet I dare appeal to, and do provoke my greateſt Enemies to produce one inſtance wherein I have declined, or warped from any one publick duty, interpretable to be incumbent upon me, as a <hi>Subject</hi> or a <hi>Church-man:</hi> But thoſe Men that anſwer Books by <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and purge themſelves by <hi>Recriminations,</hi> muſt be allowed to make uſe of all the <hi>Topicks</hi> that are within that compaſs; and to improve their deſign by the general advantages it tenders to them. A method uſed by your predeceſſor Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who after this manner diſcharges his Gall upon me. You are pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the world, That you received <hi>Epiſcopal Orders</hi> in the <hi>late Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> and think it ſufficient to vouch your early Zeal for our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy.</hi> I can ſay more, That in the year 1658, I was made a <hi>Deacon</hi> by that moſt worthy <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>reverend Prelate, Brian,</hi> then

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall make it appear that the account you give of your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> is not fair nor true, and that you conceal your crime as much as in you lies in the repreſentation; the Deſign and Plot of it being moſtly laid, if not altogether, againſt the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And this I undertake to make good in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The main ſubject of your preſent debate, you ſay, is this, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any one particular Form of Church-Government be ſetled upon an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable divine Right, by Virtue whereof, all Churches are bound to obſerve that individual Form? or, Whether it be left to the prudence of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, to agree upon that Form of Government, which it judgeth moſt conduceable within it ſelf, to attain the end of Government, the Peace, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Tranquillity, Setlement of the Church?</hi> as is to be ſeen in the latter end of your <hi>Preface,</hi> and Part 1. c. 1. Sect. 1. pag. 4. The firſt you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in the <hi>Negative,</hi> the ſecond in the <hi>Affirmative;</hi> the iſſue of both is this, <hi>That God by his own Laws hath given Men a Power and Liberty, to determine the particular Form of Church-Government among them;</hi> (you had done well if you had produced this Law of God, and what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs words of it are; none other being ſufficient for a laſting divine inſtitution by your own Rules: but this is your <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>That tho' one Form of Government be agreeable to the word, it doth not follow that another is not; or becauſe one is lawful, another is unlawful, but one Form may be more agreeable to ſome parts, places, people, and time, than others are: That the caſe is the ſame as to Church Government, whether by many joyn'd together in an equality, or by ſubordination of ſome perſons unto others, as it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101155:14"/>
is to dipping or ſprinkling in Baptiſm, whether thrice or once? As to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Lords Table, whether at Supper time, or in the Morning, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or after meat?</hi> (You add, <hi>whether kneeling, or ſitting, or leaning:</hi>) and <hi>as to preaching the word,</hi> you mean doubtleſs, Whether by an Hour-glaſs, or not? <hi>Vid.</hi> Part I. Cap. 1. Sect. 1. pag. 3. §. 2. p. 9, 10. Part. II. Cap. 4. §. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And hence it is as plain and obvious as words and conſequences can make it: That by the Law of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtating Mankind with this perpetual indefectible Power, the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Congregational</hi> Form of Government, is equally to be received as the <hi>Presbyterian and Claſſical;</hi> and either of them, as the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and the <hi>Papal,</hi> hath as firm a bottom as any of them all; any one of them ought to be called, and really is, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of God, within this Dominion, if the <hi>Paſtors,</hi> or the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or (when theſe are knockt o'th' head) the <hi>People,</hi> or any one prevailing inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or faction, ſhall appoint and ſetle it among us. So that now you are for a <hi>Toleration of ſeveral Forms of Government,</hi> by the <hi>Authority of the Church of England:</hi> And it is plain whence our Sects had it, when with ſo much confidence they ſaid upon each occaſion (having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>indulgence</hi> from his late <hi>Majeſty</hi>) That they were the <hi>Church of England,</hi> they meant according to Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet's Irenicum.</hi> And indeed according to this Principle of yours, <hi>Richard Baxter's Conventicle</hi> in St. <hi>Martin's Pariſh in the Fields,</hi> was once as much of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi>'s Church in St. <hi>Andrew's Holborn:</hi> Neither is this the only Caſe that they uſe your Authority in, thereby to rend in pieces this Church; and I did not ſpeak improperly, nor without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when I called that Treatiſe an <hi>unlucky Book.</hi> This iſſue is plainly and clearly ſet down by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Part III. Cap. 42. pag. 299, 300. and upon your very Principles, to whom you had an Ear no doubt; <q>From this conſolidation of the Rights Politick and Eccleſiaſtick in Chriſtian Sovereigns, it is evident they have all manner of Power over their Subjects, that can be given to Man, for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mens external Actions, both in Policy and Religion; and may make ſuch Laws, as themſelves ſhall judge fitteſt for the Government of their own Subjects, both as they are the Common-Wealth, and as they are the Church:</q> For both Church and State are the ſame Men, (which is your very notion, as will appear anon.) <q>If they pleaſe therefore they may (as many Chriſtian Kings now do) commit the Government of their Subjects in matters of Religion to the Pope; but then the Pope is in that point ſubordinate to them, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes that charge in anothers Dominion, <hi>jure civili,</hi> in the right of the civil Sovereign, not <hi>jure divino,</hi> in God's right; and may therefore be diſcharged of that office, when the Sovereign for the good of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101155:14"/>
ſhall think it neceſſary. They may alſo, if they pleaſe, commit the care of Religion to one ſupreme Paſtor, or to an Aſſembly of Paſtors, and give them what power over the Church, or over one another, they think moſt convenient; and what Titles of Honour, as of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Archbiſhops, Prieſts or Presbyters, they will; — and theſe Rights are incident to all Severeigns, whether Monarchs or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: For they that are repreſentants of a Chriſtian People, are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentants of the Church; for a Church and a Commonwealth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People, are the ſame thing.</q> The inconſiſtences and moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, inſufferable conſequents of this Principle, are abundantly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the World, by a moſt judicious Hand, in the <hi>Caſe of the Church of England,</hi> Part III. more particularly pag. 246, 247, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. You deny <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in particular, or a Diſparity of Power in the Miniſtry, to be by the Laws of Chriſt, always binding and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; wherein you oppoſe, to be ſure, the <hi>Church of England:</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the overthrowing the immutable Right of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> ſeems to be the main thing you aim at throughout the whole Diſcourſe, (tho' you pretend more;) for the management of which, you all along mingle Fire and Water together, urging any thing that will give a varniſh, or make a ſhew of Argument in order to it, tho' really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the common Chriſtianity we all profeſs; but either light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch, or deſignedly paſs by, the moſt credible motives, even demonſtrations to the contrary; even thoſe which have been own'd for ſuch by your ſelf in the like caſes. This will appear to him that weighs theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>To avoid this <hi>prelatical</hi> Power, or <hi>Superiority</hi> of our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> you tell us, <hi>That tho' it be proved that the Apoſtles had a Superiority of Order, and Juriſdiction over the Paſtors of the Church by an Act of Chriſt; yet it muſt be farther proved, That it was Chriſt's intention, that Superiority ſhould continue in their Succeſſors, or it makes nothing to the purpoſe,</hi> Part I. Cap. 1. §. 8. pag. 25. Where, you do not conſider, That tho' it be proved that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had, by an Act of Chriſt, the <hi>power of the Keys</hi> delivered unto them, and thereby were inveſted, in their Perſons, with the <hi>Miniſterial</hi> Authority; yet, upon the ſame terms, it muſt be farther proved, That it was <hi>Chriſt's Intention</hi> that the ſame power ſhould continue in their Succeſſors, or it makes no more to the <hi>purpoſe</hi> for a ſettled <hi>Miniſtery,</hi> than it does for a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> and this ſame Argument which overthrows a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> of Church-men over one another, for want of an Expreſs of Chriſts intention to continue it always, overthrows alſo the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> it ſelf, both having the ſame bottom and alike promiſes. This the <hi>Independant</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> ſaw, and conſider'd full well, and upon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101155:15"/>
your own grounds reject them both together with the two Sacraments; becauſe there are no expreſs Texts declaring their Perpetuity. But this is agreeable enough with the <hi>Rector of Sutton;</hi> who, as he makes all <hi>Goſpel-Laws</hi> for Church-Government an <hi>Eſcheat</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall:</hi> ſo is he to be ſuppoſed to receive none as perpetually obliging, except thoſe that are made and conveyed in the <hi>Hall</hi>-Phraſe, and by its Precedents, with an expreſs <hi>Declaration, Entailing</hi> them upon the <hi>Heirs and Succeſſors for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, becauſe <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> practice ſtill preſſes you hard, whoſe force, apart from the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Donation</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſeems to infer a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right (the matter of Fact being apparent and beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were inveſted with a <hi>Superiority</hi> beyond <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and did accordingly execute it.) Hereupon, with a deep deſign, but very Superficial Policy, that is eaſily ſeen through and baffled, you place their <hi>juridical conſiſtorial</hi> Acts and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, amongſt thoſe other Acts and Practices of theirs, that were pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſional, and with regard to the preſent times and circumſtances; ſuch as, <hi>abſtaining from Blood and things ſtrangled, eating or not eating,</hi> the order of <hi>Widows,</hi> the <hi>Love-Kiſs, Celibacy, St. Paul's working with his own Hands, Preaching the Goſpel freely, Circumciſing Timothy,</hi> &amp;c. all which are confeſſedly mutable, and did alter in a very little time, both in their Practice and Obligation. But your Error is not only in rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe quite different Practices, under the ſame head and order, whoſe diſtant natures are ſo plain and obvious; but in that you do not conſider that the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> and <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> will, for the ſame reaſon, come under that head of <hi>Indifferencies,</hi> and Practices mutable: and therein (beſides the ill conſequences in Religion) you plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict your ſelf, who tell us at the ſame time, and in the ſame Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (and in doing of it dart your ſelf through with your own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon) That tho' there be no particular expreſs <hi>Revelation</hi> for the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> and <hi>Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> yet <hi>Practice Apoſtolical,</hi> or of <hi>Perſons guided by an Infallible Spirit, is ſufficient</hi> to enact and declare them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually obliging. For, ſurely, <hi>Apoſtolical practice, guided by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit,</hi> is equally manifeſt ſon a <hi>Superiority</hi> in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> as for thoſe two: It is far more notorious and frequent; but your Plot that was laid againſt the <hi>Immutability of Epiſcopacy,</hi> engaged you to take no notice of it, <hi>vid.</hi> Part I. Sect. 3. Part. II. §. 20.</p>
            <p>Farther yet, That you may be every ways ſecure in your deſign, and wholly baffle and defeat all Plea for a divine and immutable Right from <hi>Apoſtolical Practice</hi> in the point of <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> you go on in a ſure way, treading <hi>Antiquity</hi> under your Foot, and impleading the moſt holy <hi>Primitive Biſhops and Confeſſors</hi> of <hi>Defectiveneſs, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity,

Partiality</hi> and <hi>Repugnancy,</hi> that hereby you may root out their <hi>Order,</hi> and deſtroy it from the Face of the Earth; and you ſay in ſo many words, That we cannot <hi>have that certainty of Apoſtolical Practice,</hi> as to conſtitute a <hi>Divine Right.</hi> It is not my buſineſs to argue points, but to collect your particular Opinions, or rather to write the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your <hi>Theology;</hi> otherwiſe I might here reply by demanding, How, and by what hands it is that we have any <hi>certainty</hi> of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Writings? or know their <hi>minds</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> there? The Church hath all along received the <hi>Canon,</hi> and Senſe of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> from the Faith and <hi>certainty</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and the repute and integrity of theſe holy <hi>Biſhops, Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors:</hi> Our Church of <hi>England</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does ſo, and they are her Rule in Reforming, as to both: and when the Authority of ſome Books of the New Teſtament were called in queſtion, the Tradition of Faith alone declared them Canonical, and they remain ſuch upon that Teſtimony, in the account of the whole Chriſtian World to this day. And why then is the ſame evidence defective and leſs authoritative concerning their practice, and ſenſe in the point of Government? But thus you expoſe the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> their Authority, their Senſe to every <hi>Atheiſt</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiuſt,</hi> to uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties and conjectures; or at the beſt to the intemperance of each vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, heady and <hi>ſceptical</hi> undertaker: And thus it comes to paſs that ſo <hi>much work</hi> is made for a <hi>Nicephorus Caliſthus,</hi> a <hi>Simeon Metaphraſtes,</hi> the very <hi>Jacobus de Voragine of the Greek Church, thoſe Tinkers that think to mend a hole, and make three inſtead of it;</hi> you taking away here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the great evidence and muniments of our Chriſtianity, both as to the matter of Fact, and the intent of it; that which is next to the <hi>Foundation, is caſt down,</hi> and what can the Righteous do? Hence ſo many Whimſies and Forgeries of Mens Brains, and monſtrous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions fill up our Bodies of Divinity (and your many forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as by Divine Right are no leſs portentous than any of them) as <hi>Geographers do Maps with ſome fabulous Creatures of their own Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Our Church of <hi>England,</hi> I ſay, in her <hi>Reformation</hi> ſuppoſes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and ſufficiency in the Records of the Primitive Church; and, that matter of Fact is faithfully tranſmitted down unto us, with the true ſenſe of the Scriptures and Apoſtolical Practice, both in matter of Doctrine and Government; and her Reformation is receiv'd by the Civil Power, and made Law in the Kingdom upon theſe terms alone; <hi>viz.</hi> As <hi>bottom'd on the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, and what the Catholick Fathers and ancient Biſhops have thence collected, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Four firſt General Councils, or any other Council, X.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101155:16"/>
quite contrary to his plain words and deſign, (which is to ſet forth the Succeſſion of <hi>Biſhops</hi> immediately from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> over the known Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>) you blaſt the credit of all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and that with as much ſhow of rancor and contempt, as the ſcornfulleſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſing your ſelf can declare. <q>What becomes then (with our <hi>Rector of Sutton</hi>) of our unqueſtionable Line of Succeſſion of Biſhops of ſeveral Churches, and the large Diagram made of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Churches, with every ones name ſet down in his order, as if the Writer had been <hi>Clarenceaux</hi> to the Apoſtles themſelves? Is it come to this at laſt, that we have nothing certain, but what we have in the Scriptures? And muſt then Tradition be our rule to interpret Scripture by? An excellent way to find out the truth, doubtleſs; to bend the Rule to the crooked Stick; to make the Judge ſtand to the Opinion of his Lacquey, what Senſe he ſhall paſs upon the Cauſe in queſtion; to make Scripture to ſtand Cap in Hand to Tradition, to know whether it may have leave to ſpeak or no. Are all the great out-crys of <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> of perſonal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, of unqueſtionable Records, reſolved at laſt into Scripture it ſelf by him, from whom theſe long Pedegrees are fetcht? Then let Succeſſion know its place, and learn to veil Bonnet to the Scriptures; and withal, Let Men take heed of over-reaching themſelves, when they would bring down ſo large a Catalogue of ſingle Biſhops, from the firſt and pureſt times of the Church: For if <hi>Euſebius</hi> profeſſeth it ſo hard to find them, well might <hi>Scaliger</hi> then complain, that the Interval from the laſt Chapter of the Acts, to the middle of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan,</hi> in which time <hi>Quadratus</hi> and <hi>Ignatius</hi> began to flouriſh, was <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>

                  </gap>, as <hi>Varro</hi> ſpeaks, a meer Chaos of time, filled up with rude conceptions of <hi>Papias, Hermes,</hi> and others, who like <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when they could not find a way through, would make one either by force or fraud.</q> Rare <hi>embelliſhments of ſtile</hi> and choice Oratory all along! When others plead for a Succeſſion of Perſons in <hi>Apoſtolical Power,</hi> out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> you ſhuffle them of, and ſay, That thoſe Fathers are to be interpreted of Succeſſion in that <hi>Apoſtolical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which was ſo eminent and notorious at <hi>Rome, Smyrna, Corinth, Philippi</hi> and <hi>Epheſus:</hi> Now you deny the truth of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> as to <hi>Doctrines</hi> alſo; but you are in an high ſtrain of Oratory, which is a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> or worſe, and your indiſpoſition plainly appears, in that you give ſuch grave advice to theſe <hi>traditional</hi> Doctors; that they place not <hi>Succeſſion</hi> before the Scriptures: You can only mean, that they deduce it not from <hi>Felix</hi> or <hi>Pontius Pilate, Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> the High-Prieſts, or the <hi>Jewiſh Sanhedrim.</hi> And have not <hi>Scaliger</hi> and you finely combined together, in giving a Character of the times immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as filled only with fraud and force? And for this reaſon alone, Leſt an unqueſtionable Succeſſion of Biſhops from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſhould appear, and their Divine Right become thereby undeniable, <hi>vid. Iren. p.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 6. §. 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it hence plainly appears what your purpoſe was in writing this Treatiſe, in that you have ſided all along with the foreign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and uſed their Arguments againſt the <hi>Divine Right of Epiſcopacy.</hi> It is the common policy, when Men deſign to deveſt any Perſon or Order of that ſuperior power which they cannot well bear, or rather deſire to have enſtated on themſelves, firſt to ſet up for a level, and the Project works mightily. Thus we know the thing aimed at in the beginning of the <hi>great Rebellion</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> was, That the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> were three equal <hi>States.</hi> And when by this ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem they had wreſted the King's Prerogative out of his hands, they then ſoon made themſelves uppermoſt, aſſumed and appropriated that very power, they had ſo violently contended againſt, as what ought not to be fixed, except in the three <hi>Eſtates</hi> in conjunction. So here, your <hi>ſham</hi> is, That all forms of Government are equally practicable; no one being of Divine Right, in that nature as to exclude another; but any one may be eſtabliſhed, as Perſons, Times and Places accord thereunto. But then your <hi>Eiſotericks,</hi> or that which you effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to your particular Friends and Confidents, is, The perpetual fixation of the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as by Divine Right unalterable; and having hereby <hi>lowered the Biſhops top-ſail</hi> (in your own expreſſion) and removed from him all that which hath been heretofore appropriated to his Order, aſſerting him to be an accidental humane creation only; in this Stirrup the <hi>Presbyter</hi> ſets his foot, and aſcends; (as the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>-men did at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>) You inveſt him with the full <hi>power of Order and Juriſdiction;</hi> and accordingly thus determine, <hi>Part</hi> II. c. 4. §. 12. That every <hi>Presbyter</hi> (from Chriſt, and perpetually fixed, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2.) hath the whole Miniſtry derived unto him in <hi>actu primo habitualiter;</hi> viz. <hi>The Power of Preaching the Word, Viſiting the Sick, Adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, of Viſiting Churches, Taking care that particular Paſtors do their duty, of Ordination and Church Cenſures, and making Rules for Decency in the Church:</hi> (The ſevereſt Aſſerter of <hi>Epiſcopal Power</hi> cannot inveſt his Biſhop in more.) And the ſame in effect you ſay over again: That every Presbyter (whom you call a <hi>fixed Officer</hi> in the Church) hath a <hi>radical, intrinſecal Power of Order in himſelf:</hi> And further, <hi>That every one, being himſelf advanced into the Authority of a Church Governor, hath an internal Power of conferring the ſame upon Perſons fit for it;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly every one did exerciſe this Power in the Churches <hi>firſt State and Period;</hi> or, <hi>In the firſt Primitive Church, before the Juriſdiction of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101155:17"/>
was reſtrain'd by mutual conſent; by way of accumulation, upon one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of a power more than he had; not by a deprivation of themſelves of that inherent Power which they enjoy'd.— It would be very ſtrange that any Officers of a Religious Society, ſhould be upon that account Out-lawed of thoſe natural Liberties, which are the reſults and products of the free actings,</hi> (pag. 252.) To which you add, That whole Churches, and Nations were without <hi>Biſhops</hi> for ſeveral Years together; ſome of which had only Presbyters at their firſt Planting; and in thoſe Churches where Epiſcopal Government was ſetled, <hi>Ordination by Presbyters was look'd upon as valid,</hi> notwithſtanding; <hi>which could not be, unleſs their Ordainers had an intrinſecal Power of Ordination;</hi> or, had they not been <hi>a fixed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, under no prohibition by Scripture;</hi> (Part II. c. 6. §. 13. pag. 273, 275. cap. 7. §. 6, 7.) In all which, I ſay, (whatever you have pretended againſt the <hi>divine perpetual Right of any one individual Government,</hi> that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> might fall with more gentleneſs and plauſibility) You ſet up a fixed laſting Government in the Church by Presbyters, as unalterable as the Miniſtry it ſelf; in whom you place the whole Power of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, never to be alienated or loſt by any authority, or under any accident, they receiving this Power with their <hi>Ordination</hi> in <hi>actu pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo habitualiter, radicaliter, intrinſically:</hi> and their execution of it is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, at any time, and in any place, even to <hi>Ordination</hi> it ſelf; and the Church hath approved and accepted of it; as when <hi>Paphnutius</hi> (tho' but a Presbyter) Ordain'd <hi>Abbot Daniel</hi> and <hi>Colluthus Iſchyras,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>pag.</hi> 379.) And hereby you give to many of the principal Patrons of the <hi>Presbyterian Parity,</hi> (as <hi>Calvin, Beza, Chamier, Gerſom, Bucer, Du Moulin,</hi> even <hi>Salmaſius, Blondel</hi> and <hi>Daillée</hi>) what they deſire and contend for; they having all along allowed of our <hi>Hierarchy</hi> upon your terms: And all the advantage the <hi>Church of England</hi> receives by the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> is, You make <hi>Biſhops</hi> for her, as the <hi>Common-wealth-men</hi> make <hi>Kings,</hi> by <hi>Accumulation,</hi> not <hi>Deprivation</hi> (in your Expreſſions juſt now mention'd;) and conſequently, retaining the Power entire to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they unmake them again when they pleaſe; or, (to expreſs it farther in your own words, which are the apteſt I have met withal) When <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances, Prudence</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> or the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Government</hi> requires it. And ſo the Biſhop (like thoſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Officers of old, as <hi>Sub-Deacons, Acolouthi, Door-keepers,</hi> &amp;c.) may be outed, as the <hi>Perpetual Presbyter</hi> ſhall ſee occaſion. Mr. <hi>Prolocutor</hi> to the <hi>Aſſembly-men</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> never ſpake more bravely to the point. And to fix all this ſurely on the leſs wary, and inconſiderate Reader, as a Nail driven by the <hi>Maſters</hi> of our <hi>Aſſembly</hi> alſo, you bring in ſeveral of our own <hi>Biſhops</hi> for evidence againſt themſelves, and their Order, in the days of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and our whole Church eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101155:17"/>
by <hi>Law,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Queen Elizabeth:</hi> As is to be ſeen in your <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> and thoſe other Citations throughout your laſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter. And when you had with ſo much eaſe and ſcorn rejected the Doctrines of all the <hi>Primitive Biſhops</hi> in the caſe, it was no ſmall piece of confidence to think to carry your Cauſe by the teſtimony (whether true or falſe) of our own Prelates of the laſt Age. But you are not content to overthrow their Order, unleſs you may fix ſuch a Scandal upon their Perſons, as the Betrayers of it.</p>
            <p>And, indeed, your ſtating this caſe of the <hi>mutability of Epiſcopacy,</hi> can be only a deſign to fool and baffle it, and thereby render it a very <hi>Babel</hi> or <hi>Idol,</hi> in the language of its madder Adverſaries; and in the conception of every one elſe, ſo trivially accidental a thing, that it cannot be really contended for upon a Church account; every accident giving occaſion (though Prudence will always be pretended) for its abolition. And it is obſervable, That there are not any of your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that conclude themſelves under an obligation to adhere unto it, any longer than it ſupports and ſerves them by the advantage of the <hi>ſecular Power.</hi> As the Church is that <hi>Tree</hi> in the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi> ſo <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is one of its <hi>bearing Boughs,</hi> in which you can be content to ſit and ſing, ſo long as you fill your Pockets; but when the gathering time is over, it is to be cut down as that which <hi>cumbereth the ground:</hi> And you plead the ſame expreſs directions for it our Saviour once gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> I'll ſtate it together with the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal Hypotheſes,</hi> thereby to make it obvious upon the naked proſpect. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> aſſerts, That each <hi>Presbyter</hi> hath the whole Power of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and is enabled to diſcharge every Church-Office; and that a reſtraint or enlargement is ſinful. The <hi>Epiſcopari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> aſſerts, That this Power is placed in the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter;</hi> but unequally: And that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath ſome inſtances of it, peculiar to his Order, as Prerogatives, and Incommunicable; which if laid aſide, will be Sacrilege in him, as alſo if aſſumed by the <hi>Presbyter.</hi> You aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert all that in the <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and loſe all that from the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that the <hi>Presbyter</hi> deſires and contends for: only here is the difference; You allow the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> upon ſome occaſions, and in ſome inſtances of their Office, to make a <hi>Deputy,</hi> with a reſerved Power to recal the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at pleaſure, or upon each ſuſpicion of his undue behaviour. And this is the honour and ſervice you do the <hi>Church of England;</hi> Theſe the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> you tell us, you deſign'd to <hi>gain upon;</hi> and that your <hi>deſign did not want ſucceſs both here and in a neighbouring Kingdom.</hi> If you mean our <hi>Northern Neighbours,</hi> I hope Epiſcopacy is ſetled there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better grounds: if it be not, ſome of the thanks for it are due to you. If you mean our <hi>Neighbours</hi> in the <hi>South;</hi> they came over indeed,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101155:18"/>
but it is with their own Presbyterian Orders, which they ſtill adhere to as their commiſſion from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> The Epiſcopal Ordination which they receive here, only enabling them for the <hi>Loaves;</hi> to which they could have no right otherways, by the <hi>Laws</hi> of our <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>D.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of the Regal Power</hi> in one; and of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> in the other. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> did, in effect, the ſame; and within the ſpace of four Years, both applauds and condemns <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> and the <hi>Rump Parliament</hi> for removing it, according to his preſent ſubject and deſign; and <hi>John Milton,</hi> the worſt of Men, takes from thence a juſt occaſion to <hi>harangue</hi> and vilifie him, in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his worſt of Books, Entituled, <hi>Pro Populo Anglicano Defenſio.</hi> And the reaſons for it are plain, as themſelves ſtate the caſe: the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s <hi>Conſecration</hi> being only an humane Rite, performed at his <hi>Deputation</hi> and Enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the execution of that Power which he had before, when he was made a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> by virtue of which, there is no farther power conferr'd; but only a Church Bleſſing, with Impoſition of Hands; a legally qualifying him for poſſeſſion, according to the particular cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of that <hi>Kingdom</hi> in which he is to exerciſe his <hi>Epiſcopal Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And laſtly, for our own Country-men; it may be wiſhed ſome of them have not on this ſcore alſo received <hi>Epiſcopal Ordination;</hi> and then they may be bound to thank you, becauſe they kept their <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> thereby, and had farther acceſſion of <hi>Church Dignities,</hi> upon his late Majeſty's bleſſed return: But I cannot think it is for this, that your <hi>Superiors in the Church have for ſo long a time been pleaſed to treat you with that kindneſs</hi> you ſeem to boaſt of. Sure I am, all the <hi>kindneſs</hi> you have done hereby to the Church of <hi>England</hi> and her <hi>Biſhops,</hi> may be put in their Eyes, and they ſee never the worſe for it. Tho' I will not ſay ſo of the unkindneſs ſhe hath received from you.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it will farther appear with what affection and byaſs you wrote this Treatiſe, if we conſider your different behaviour to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi> even <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> upon each occaſion. It is but a little to reflect upon thoſe ſlender civilities, which you ſhew all along to that great and eminent Divine, Dr. <hi>Henry Hammond,</hi> one that was every ways great and conſiderable, provoking reverence and reſpect from his Adverſaries, that were in any meaſure civilized: Such was his Learning, Integrity, Courage, in thoſe perillous times he lived in;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101155:18"/>
the <hi>Ark</hi> it ſelf reſted peculiarly upon his Shoulders. But, I ſay, your unhandſom behaviour to him may eaſier be paſſed by, becauſe he was but one ſingle Doctor in our Church; you ſeem to treat him with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain (tho', all things conſider'd, there was then as great a diſtance betwixt him and the <hi>Rector of Sutton,</hi> as there is now betwixt the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> of <hi>Coſmus Blene,</hi> and the <hi>Dean</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s;) you reject at once his <hi>Five and thirty Teſtimonies,</hi> produced out of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as inconluding: Even that one, which ſeems to have ſome <hi>Semblance,</hi> you ſay is <hi>clearly miſtaken;</hi> and your proof is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious and inconſiſtent, that there needs no other evidence of your partiality, and that your Plot was only to expoſe Him and the Cauſe. (<hi>Part. II. c.</hi> 6. §. 17. <hi>p.</hi> 309.) And no wonder when you have reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ignatius</hi> himſelf, as Spurious and Counterfeit; and the <hi>ſtory of him (as much as it is defended with his Epiſtles) as not to ſeem any of the moſt probable;</hi> placing it among the <hi>uncertain fabulous narrations of Antiquity,</hi> (§. 16. p. 298.) When you have derided all <hi>Antiquity</hi> at once, you go on againſt our moſt worthy Doctor, rejecting what is offer'd by him, as that <hi>which hath neither evidence nor pertinency enough to ſtop the paſſage of one who is returning to his former matter:</hi> that is, in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, it is not worth the conſideration of your pondering ſelf, imployed on a more pertinent and advantageous ſubject, and which hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter motives of credibility. (Sect. 9. pag. 260.) You farther yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him (if poſſible) more contemptible, and as one that betrays the <hi>Reformation</hi> by his infirm <hi>Hypotheſis, which was built upon reaſons of greater ſtrength and evidence, than what he hath pleaded.</hi> (§. 9. p. 258.) Once more, and which may go for all, You repreſent him as a Rattle Head, without any ſhew or appearance of Reaſon, and his performance (with the <hi>embelliſhment of your</hi> rare Similitude) is thus expreſſed, <hi>Only the Wind-Egg of a working Fancy, that wants a ſhell of Reaſon to cover it:</hi> When all may be true that he there aſſerts, notwithſtanding your Eight Reaſons that are brought againſt it, (<hi>Cap.</hi> 6. §. 3.) However your Metaphor is to be admired, eſpecially for the great humility of it: It is not like that <hi>lofty Similitude</hi> ſome have uſed, <hi>borrowed from a Crowned Head,</hi> but from an <hi>Egg ſhell;</hi> and nothing but another of your own can parallel it, only the ſtrain is a little higher, and you ſtrike at all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind therewith, which doth not <hi>think, opine, reaſon</hi> (in the words of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and with the ſame haughtineſs) as you do: <hi>Which prejudice being the Yellow-Jaundice of the Soul, leaves ſuch a Tincture upon the Eyes of the underſtanding, that till it be cured of that Icteriſm, it cannot ſee things in their proper colours.</hi> (Sect. 2. c. 5. p. 200.)</p>
            <p>You go on from Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> to the whole <hi>Church of England,</hi> which you hit at one blow; and <hi>enquiring more ſtrictly</hi> into the cauſes of the

great <hi>Diſtances and Animoſities, which have riſen upon this Controverſie,</hi> you fix upon the Epiſcopal Men, as the <hi>Troublers of Iſrael,</hi> whom you thus divide. <hi>Thoſe whom the prevalency of Faction and Intereſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, their Revenues having come from the Rents of the Church</hi> (which is the odious old way of Characterizing (for ſcorn and contempt) to the People the ancient and zealous Biſhops and Clergy of our Church) and <hi>others of greater Integrity;</hi> (you mean that were leſs Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and Rapacious, and believed their <hi>Order</hi> to be more than their <hi>Revenues;</hi>) but deſcend alſo with this <hi>falſe Principle or Hypotheſis, which Men are apt to take for granted without proving it,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is in no caſe lawful to vary from that Form, which by obſcure and uncertain Conjectures, they conceive to have been the Primitive Practice.</hi> (Part I. c. 1. §. 1. p. 4.) And as you begin, ſo you end, fixing this farther Character upon them, in your laſt Chapter; <hi>I know it is the laſt</hi> Aſylum <hi>which many run to,</hi> (meaning ſuch as <hi>found all things upon a Divine Right,) when they are beaten off from their Imaginary Fancies, by pregnant teſtimonies of Scripture and Reaſon, to ſhelter themſelves under the</hi>

And the greateſt part of that Chapter is ſpent in repreſenting our <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> to be againſt themſelves, to their manifeſt injury, reproach and diſhonour, as I ſhall make it appear in publick in a very little time, if God continue me Life and Health. And if at any time you give a <hi>Church of England Man</hi> his due, or a favourable Character, it is when he is on your ſide, or the queſtion of <hi>Divine Right</hi> is not under debate, or you deſign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to advance your own cauſe; and you range him with <hi>our Reverend and Learned Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>in his Chriſtian Concord;</hi> and then he muſt be a pure <hi>Church of England Man</hi> in your conceptions of him.</p>

Nay, you ſtate the caſe and apply it directly and ſolely againſt <hi>Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> or a <hi>Superiority of Order and Juriſdiction over the Paſtors of the Church,</hi> (Sect. 8. p. 25.) which was not fair, nor conſequently <hi>a due means to bring thoſe over to a compliance to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>(then likely to be re-eſtabliſhed,) who ſtood upon the ſuppoſition, That Chriſt had appointed a Presbyterian Government to be always continued in his Church.</hi> And it is eaſily obſervable, that you have omitted nothing that was pleaded by them, whereby <hi>Prelacy</hi> might be rendered deteſtable as an unlawful <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation:</hi> but whether you have done the ſame, thereby to render <hi>Presbytery</hi> as ſuch, I appeal to that very Chapter. You are ſo far from it, that the ſame deſign is managed throughout the whole Book, where your Plea is againſt the <hi>Divine Right of any one individual Form of Government;</hi> but the inſtance is moſtly againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy: Presbytery</hi> is ſeldom mentioned with any mark of diſreſpect; or if it be, it is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally. I do not remember any one ſet diſcourſe particularly level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt it, as there is ſometimes againſt the <hi>Independents,</hi> but all along againſt the <hi>Church of England;</hi> both in this and ſeveral other of her moſt conſiderable Tenents, and <hi>Articles.</hi> Nay, you expreſly, and in ſo many words, give the precedency to <hi>Presbytery,</hi> founding it upon one of your <hi>neceſſary and unalterable Divine Rights,</hi> (Part I. c. 1. §. 7, 8. pag. 23, 26.) and ſay, <hi>That the Presbyterians ſeem more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to own the uſe of General Rules, and the light of Nature, in order to the Form of Church-Government, as in the Subordination of Courts, Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Aſſemblies, and the more moderate ſort, as to Lay-Elders:</hi> And to the <hi>Independents</hi> in the next place, who <hi>plead the general Rules of Scripture, and evidence of natural Reaſon.</hi> Now all this you muſt be ſuppoſed to remove from the <hi>Epiſcoparians,</hi> becauſe therein you place the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if you do any thing. And beſides, you ſay further, <hi>The Epiſcopal Men will hardly find any evidence in Scripture, or the Practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for Churches conſiſting of many Congregations for Worſhip, under the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101155:20"/>
charge of one Perſon in the Primitive Church for the Ordination of a Biſhop, without the preceeding Election of the Clergy, and at leaſt conſent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the People; and neither in Scripture nor Antiquity, the leaſt Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of a delegation of Church-Power;</hi> and leave them <hi>no other Foundation, but the Principles of humane Prudence,</hi> and thoſe not very well obſerved. (<hi>Pag.</hi> 416, 417.) So then, upon the winding up of your Book, the <hi>Church of England</hi> is repreſented, without <hi>evidence of natural Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>the Rules of the Light of Nature,</hi> with <hi>little evidence from Scripture,</hi> or <hi>the Practice of the Apoſtles,</hi> in ſome inſtances of her Worſhip and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; but with none in others; neither is Prudence her conſtant Guide. And was not this a hopeful way and delicate <hi>means to bring over Diſſenters to a compliance with the Church of England, then likely to be establiſhed?</hi> But none of it is to be wonder'd at, if we conſider the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you have given of the <hi>Government of our Church,</hi> in the name of the <hi>Foreign Divines a little before, (pag.</hi> 409.) and the <hi>inconveniencies</hi> it is liable unto, <hi>as a ſtep to Pride and Ambition, and an occaſion whereby Men might do the Church injury by the exceſs of their Power, if they were not Men of excellent Temper and Moderation;</hi> inſomuch, that our <hi>Biſhops are begg'd rather to lay down their Power, than to tranſmit that Power to thoſe after them, who, it may be, were not like to ſucceed them in their Meekneſs and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and at laſt they are left to the <hi>Judgment of thoſe who have the Power, not only to redreſs, but prevent abuſes incroaching by an irregular Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet you have not left her barely to her Judges, (or the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate, for ſuch you can be interpreted only to mean,) to ſtand and fall at their diſcretion; your ſelf appear as Council againſt her, prepoſſeſſing them with new fears and jealouſies; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you produce a ridiculous Prediction of <hi>Padre Paulo, viz.</hi> That the <hi>Church of England would then find the inconveniencies of Epiſcopacy, when an high Spirited Biſhop ſhould come once to rule the Church:</hi> A Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that in all likelihood was forged in the Brain of ſome <hi>Puritan;</hi> and my reaſon for it is, Becauſe I find it placed in the front of a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Treatiſe, writ by one of great intemperance and violence againſt the <hi>Church of England;</hi> the Title whereof is, <hi>Irenaei Philadelphi Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtola ad Renatum Virideum, in qua aperitur myſterium iniquitatis noviſſimè in Anglia redivivum, &amp; excutitur liber Joſephi Hall, quo aſſeritur Epiſcopatum eſſe Juris Divini.

The deſign of it is to inveigh againſt the <hi>praetorian</hi> Authority of Biſhops, with their Pride and Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation over the <hi>Clergy:</hi> and he ſtates the caſe juſt as you have done in your <hi>Irenicum, viz.</hi> againſt their Solitary appropriated Power by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right,</hi> allowing a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> by the Law of Chriſt; and that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules are given in Scripture, for the <hi>great ends of Peace and Order.</hi> But the particular Form depends upon the choice of the Presbyters,

That no other Perſons have power to make Laws binding Men to obedience, but only the Civil Magiſtrate;</hi> with-holding nothing from him, but <hi>Preaching the Goſpel, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments;</hi> in which two things, you ſay, conſiſts the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Exerciſe of the Miniſterial Function,</hi> derived by Chriſt unto his Miniſters, making the Magiſtrate his own <hi>Guide,</hi> according to the <hi>Word of God in the Adminiſtration of his Function,</hi> (and by conſequence his own Preacher) <hi>not ſubject to the Power of the Miniſters;</hi> that is, he is to interpret the Scriptures to himſelf; which comes very near to that of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> (Part III. c. 4. p. 252.) <hi>No Man ought in the Interpretation of Scripture, to proceed farther than the bounds that are ſet by their ſeveral Sovereigns.</hi> As alſo (p. 295. c. 42.) <hi>That the right of judging what Doctrines are fit for Peace, and to be taught by Subjects, is in all Commonwealths inſeparably annexed to the Sovereign Power Civil, whether it be in one Man, or in one Aſſembly of Men.</hi> You go on at the ſame rate, and ſay, <hi>The Power of declaring the Obligation of former Laws, and of conſulting and adviſing the Magiſtrate for ſetling of new Laws, for the Polity of the Church, belongs to the Paſtors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Church of God; but they have no more Authority to make any new Laws or Conſtitutions binding Mens Conſciences, than a command from the Supreme Authority, that inferior Magiſtrates ſhould be obeyed, doth imply in them any Power to make new Laws to bind them. Power ariſing from mutual compact and conſent of parties, is moſt agreeable to the nature of Church-Power, being not coactive but directive: And ſuch was the confederate diſcipline of the Primitive Church, before they had any Chriſtian Magiſtrate; thence the decrees of Councils were called Canons, and not Laws. The great uſe of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and Aſſemblies of Paſtors of Churches, is to be as the Council of the Church to the King, in matters belonging to the Church, as the Parliament is in matters of Civil Concernment. Elective Synods, ſubſtituted in the place of Authoritative Power, to determine Controverſies, are</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>will never be ſoveraign enough to cure the diſtemper it is brought for,</hi> (that is reſerved for your <hi>Weapon-Salve,) and bind no farther than the party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd doth judge the Sentence equal and juſt. So that they help us with no ways to end Controverſies in the Church, any farther than the Perſons engaged are willing to account that juſt, which ſhall be judged in their Caſe;</hi> they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>no juridical Power. The Church Power, as to divine Law, is only directive and declarative, but being confirmed by a Civil Sanction is juridical and obligatory. As for that time when the Church was without Magiſtrates ruling in it, in thoſe things undetermined by the Word of God, they acted out of principles of Chriſtian Prudence, and from the principles of the Law of Nature.</hi> And the reaſons that you give for all this are many, I'll in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in but two. Firſt, <hi>Becauſe Church-men have no Authority, but are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101155:23"/>
bound up to the commands of Chriſt, already laid down in his Word;</hi> (and why may not the ſame be ſaid of the Magiſtrates, and that they are equally tied up to the Laws of Chriſt?) <hi>For a Power to bind Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to their determinations, lodged in the Officers of the Church,</hi> muſt be <hi>derived either from a Law of God, giving them this Right; or elſe from conſent of Parties: For any Law of God, there is none produced with probability of reaſon, but that, <hi>Obey thoſe that are over you in the Lord.</hi> But that implies no more than ſubmitting to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Goſpel, and to thoſe whom Chriſt hath constituted as Paſtors of his Church, wherein the Law of Christ doth require Obedience to them, that is, looking upon them, and owning them in their Relations to them as Paſtors; but that gives no Authority to make Laws,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, <hi>He who can null and declare all other Obligations void, done without his Power, hath the only Power to oblige; for whatſoever destroys a former Obligation, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity imply a Power to oblige, becauſe I am bound to obey him in the abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that I was formerly obliged to: But this Power belongs to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</hi> (I might here alſo again demand, By what Law in your Senſe? But it is your bare Opinion I am now to relate, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons you produce, not to ſhew the rottenneſs of them.) <hi>For ſuppoſe in ſome indifferent Rites and Ceremonies, the Church repreſentative, that is, the Governors of it,</hi> pro tempore, <hi>do preſcribe them to be obſerv'd by all, the Supreme Power forbids the doing thoſe things; if this doth not null the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſuppoſed Obligation, I must inevitably run upon theſe abſurdities:</hi> Firſt, <hi>That there are two Supreme Powers in a Nation at the ſame time.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That a Man may lie under two different Obligations as to the ſame thing; he is bound to do it by one Power, and not to do it by the other.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>The ſame action may be a Duty and a Sin; a Duty in obeying the one Power, a Sin in diſobeying the other. Therefore there can be but one Power to oblige, which is that of the Supreme Magiſtrate,</hi> (where, by the way, I note that theſe laſt reaſons are the very ſame that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> urges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this very Branch of Church-Power, in his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Part II. c. 29. and Part III. c. 10. pag. 248.) The ſumm of all is this, and I chooſe to expreſs my ſelf in the words of a very Learned and Judicious Writer upon the like occaſion; <q>You diſtinguiſh betwixt the Sacred Function, which you grant to be the proper Office of the Church, and the Power over Sacred Things, which you annex entirely to the Civil Power. By which diſtinction, you leave the Governors of the Church no other Power, than to adminiſter the Offices of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without any Power of puniſhing Offenders againſt the Laws of Religion.</q> I confeſs (Part. I. c. 8.) you own the Church to be a Society diſtinct from other Societies, with <hi>Laws, Ends and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of a diſtinct Nature,</hi> (and you had done the ſame before, (Cap.

2. §. 3. p. 35.) juſt, almoſt, before you enter'd upon this grand determination) and with puniſhments diſtinct from the Civil, and for Spiritual ends, which you call <hi>Excommunication, or an Excluſion of the offending Perſon from Communion with the Society;</hi> and ſay, That <hi>this Power is peculiar to the Church:</hi> But this reacheth not to the point, as to <hi>Church-Laws,</hi> or to the Power of puniſhing Offenders againſt the Laws of Religion. Beſides, you have called this Church the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> all-along; and inveſted him alone with <hi>Church-Power,</hi> or a Power diſtinct from that properly called <hi>Political,</hi> which can be no other than <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical:</hi> and you have inſtanced only in <hi>Preaching the Word, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring the Sacraments,</hi> as the two Offices, in which the <hi>Authoritative exerciſe of the miniſterial Function, derived by Chriſt to his Diſciples,</hi> doth conſiſt: But all this I have ſhew'd to be contrary to the judgment and Practice of the whole <hi>Church of God,</hi> both <hi>Biſhops, Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> of the <hi>Emperors</hi> themſelves, in the beſt Ages of the <hi>Church,</hi> and when they were her <hi>Defenders;</hi> to the determinations of our own Church, and the <hi>Laws</hi> of our <hi>Kingdom:</hi> It is the deſign and ſubject of my whole Book, and I am alſo mightily ſecured that I did not take one Argument that Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had uſed before, to be ſure, in his <hi>Irenicum.</hi>

                           <p>And there is no more Promiſe of God, that Grace is given in the committing of the Eccleſiaſtical Office, than it is in the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Civil. In the Apoſtles
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101155:24"/>
time, when there was no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, by whoſe Authority Miniſters of God's Word might be appointed, nor Sins by the Sword corrected, there was no remedy then for the correction of Vice, or appointing of Miniſters, but only the conſent of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Multitude among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with an uniform conſent to follow the Advice and Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Perſons whom God had moſt endued with the Spirit of Wiſdom and Counſel. And at that time, foraſmuch as Chriſtian People had no Sword nor Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor among themſelves, they were conſtrain'd of neceſſity to take ſuch Curates and Prieſts as either they knew themſelves to be meet thereunto, or elſe as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto them by others, that were ſo repleat with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, with ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Profeſſion of Chriſt, ſuch Wiſdom, ſuch Converſation and Counſel, that they ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of very Conſcience to give credit unto them, and to accept ſuch as by them were preſented. And ſometimes the Apoſtles and others, unto whom God had given abundantly his Spirit, ſent or appointed Miniſters of God's Word; ſometimes the People did chooſe ſuch as they thought meet thereunto. And when any were appointed, or ſent by the Apoſtles or other, the People of their own voluntary will, with thanks did accept them; not for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101155:25"/>
the Supremity, Impery and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion that the Apoſtles had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, to command as their Princes or Maſters; but as good People ready to obey the voice of good Counſellors, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any thing that was neceſſary for their edification and benefit.</p>
                           <p>A Biſhop may make a Prieſt by the Scriptures, and ſo may Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Governors alſo; and that by the Authority of God committed unto them; and the People alſo by their Election. For as we read that Biſhops have done it, ſo Chriſtian Emperors and Princes uſually have done it: And the People before Chriſtian Princes were, commonly did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Biſhops and Prieſts.</p>
                           <p>In the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> he that is appointed to be a Biſhop or Prieſt, needeth no Conſecration by the Scripture; for Election, or appointing thereunto is ſufficient.</p>
                           <p>If it fortuned, a Prince Chriſtian learned to Conquer certain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of Infidels, having none but the Temporal learned Men with him; it is not againſt God's Law, that he and they ſhould Preach and Teach the Word of God there: And alſo to make and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Biſhops and Prieſts, that the Word of God ſhould be there Preached; and the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and others be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred. But contrary, they ought, indeed, ſo to do; and there be Hiſtories that witneſs, That ſome Chriſtian Princes and Lay-men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſecrate have done the ſame.</p>
                           <p>A Biſhop or Prieſt by the Scripture, is neither commanded nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to Excommunicate. But where the Law of any Region giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him Authority to Excommunicate, there they ought to uſe the ſame in ſuch Crimes as the Laws have Authority in. And where the Laws of the Region forbid them, there they have no Authority at all: And they that be no Prieſts may alſo Excommunicate, if the Law allow thereunto.</p>

                           <p>Again, let the Right of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them be in the Church; for ſo it was in the time of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves; even ſo alſo
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101155:24"/>
the Right will be in the Civil Sovereign Chriſtian. For in that he is a Chriſtian, he allows the Teaching; and in that he is a Sovereign, (which is as much as to ſay, the Church by repreſentation) the Teachers he Elects, are Elected by the Church. And when an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Chriſtians chooſe their Paſtor in a Chriſtian Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is the Soveraign that Elects him, becauſe it is done by his Authority; in the ſame manner as when a Town chooſe their Mayor, it is the act of him that hath the Sovereign Power: For every act done, is the act of him, without whoſe conſent it is invalid.</p>
                           <p>Seeing then in every Chriſtian Commonwealth, the Civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign is the Supreme Paſtor, to whoſe charge the Flock of his Subjects is committed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that it is by his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that all other Paſtors are made, and have Power to teach, and perform all other Paſtoral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: It follows alſo, that it is from the Civil Sovereign, That all other Paſtors derive their Right of Teaching, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Functions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to that Office: and that they are but his Miniſters, in the ſame manner as Magiſtrates of Towns, Judges in Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Commanders of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are all but Miniſters of him that is the Magiſtrate of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101155:24"/>
the whole Commonwealth, Judge of all Cauſes, and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the whole Militia; which is always the Civil Sovereign.</p>
                           <p>If a Man therefore ſhould ask a Paſtor, in the execution of his Office, as the Chief Prieſts and Elders of the People (<hi>Matth.</hi> 21.23.) asked our Saviour, By what Authority doſt thou theſe things? and who gave thee this Authority? he can make no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſt anſwer, but, That he doth it by the Authority of the Commonwealth, given him by the King, or Aſſembly that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth it: All Paſtors, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Supreme, execute their charges in the Right; that is to ſay, by the Authority of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Sovereign, that is, <hi>Jure Civili.</hi> But the King and every other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, executeth his Office of Supreme Paſtor by immediate Authority from God; that is to ſay in God's Right, or <hi>Jure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But if every Chriſtian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign be the Supreme Paſtor of his own Subjects, it ſeemeth that he hath alſo Authority not only to Preach (which, perhaps, no Man will deny) but alſo to Baptize, and to Adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and to Conſecrate both Temples and Paſtors to God's Service. There is no doubt, but any King, in caſe he were skilful in the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, might, by the ſame Right of his Office, read Lectures of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101155:25"/>

                        <p>And laſtly concludes, <q>That Impoſition of Hands is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the authorizing a King to Baptize, and Conſecrate, or Exerciſe any part of the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Function; every Sovereign, before Chriſtianity, having the Power of Teaching and Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teachers; but it only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them in the way of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truth: And conſequently, they needed no Impoſition of Hands (beſides that which is done in Baptiſm) to authorize them to exerciſe any part of the Paſtoral Function, as namely to Baptize and Conſecrate.</q>

That every one hath a</hi> judicium privatae diſcretionis, <hi>which is the rule of Practice as to himſelf: And though we freely allow a Miniſterial Power, under Chriſt, in the Governors of the Church; yet that extends not to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation upon Men, to go againſt the dictates of their own reaſon and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Their Power is only directive and declarative, and in matters of duty bind no more, than reaſon and evidence brought from Scripture by them doth. A Man hath not the Power over his own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, much leſs can others have; if Governors muſt be Judges, what things are lawful in this caſe, what not, the Power will be abſolute: for to be ſure what ever they command, they will ſay is lawful. If every private Perſon muſt judge, (as when all is ſaid every private Man will be his own Judge in this caſe, in things concerning his own welfare) then he is no farther bound to obey, than he judgeth the thing to be lawful which is commanded,</hi> And at laſt, after other Arguings of this nature, you conclude: <hi>So that, Let Men wind and turn themſelves which way they will, by the very ſame Arguments, that any will prove ſeparation from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>lawful, becauſe ſhe required unlawful things, as conditions of her Communion; it will be proved lawful, not to conform to any ſuspected or unlawful Practice,</hi> required by <hi>any Church-Governors upon the ſame terms; if the thing ſo required be after ſerious and ſober enquiry, judged unwarrantable by a Man's own Conſcience.</hi> You particularly accuſe the preſent Government and Governors of our Church, (becauſe not complying to offers of union and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) as wanting of that tenderneſs and prudence, that was viſible in the firſt Primitive Church; in our Church at the compoſure of her Liturgy; and in the French Churches at the making of theirs. I will repeat your own Words, becauſe I would not lie under a ſuſpicion of doing you injury. <hi>Were we ſo happy but to take off things granted unneceſſary by all, and ſuſpected by many, and judged unlawful by ſome; and to make nothing the Bonds of our Communion, but what Chriſt hath done,</hi> viz. <hi>one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>allowing a Liberty for matters of indifferency, and bearing with the weakneſs of thoſe who cannot bear things which others count lawful; we might, indeed, be reſtored to a true primitive luſtre far ſooner, than by furbiſhing up ſome few antiquated Ceremonies, which can derive their Pedigree no higher, than ſome ancient Cuſtom and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101155:26"/>
God will convince Men one day, that the union of the Church lies more in the unity of Faith and Affection, than uniformity of doubtful Rites and Ceremonies. Were there that Spirit of mutual condeſcenſion, which was moſt certainly in the firſt and primitive Church, in the Apoſtles time, our breaches, as to this thing too, might ſoon be cloſed up, and the voice of Schiſm be heard among us no more. — Certainly thoſe Holy Men, in the compoſing our Liturgy, who did ſeek by any means to draw in others, at ſuch a diſtance from their Principles as the Papiſts were, did never intend, by what they did for that end, to exclude any truly tender conſciences from their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. That which they laid a bate for them was never intended by them as a hook for thoſe of their own profeſſion. The ſame reaſon which at that time made them yield ſo far to them then, would now have perſwaded them to alter and lay aſide thoſe things, which yield matter of offence to any of the ſame profeſſion with themſelves now: It cannot but be looked upon as a token of God's ſevere diſpleaſure againſt us — if any fair offers of union and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be coldly embraced and entertained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is this all; but you have equally obliged the Faction in other parts of your Book, and cenſured our Church after the ſame manner. Your words are theſe, (<hi>pag.</hi> 64.) <hi>I am ſure it is contrary to the Primitive Practice and Moderation then uſed, to Suſpend or Deprive Men of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Function, for not Conforming in Habits, Geſtures,</hi> &amp;c. which you incomparably prove out of <hi>Walafridus Strabo; Becauſe there was no diſtinction of Habits in the Church in the Primitive times;</hi> and then to be ſure there was no <hi>Suſpenſions</hi> and <hi>Deprivations</hi> for not wearing them. And you again pretty handſomely gird our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Church-men,</hi> as <hi>Publick-Prayer-Readers;</hi> and for not anſwering the end of their <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which is, To be <hi>Diſpenſers of God's holy Word:</hi> That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not <hi>ſent forth to Pray, but to Preach;</hi> and <hi>therein Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are to ſucceed them:</hi> That Prayer (among our <hi>Church-men) is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as</hi> Sarah, <hi>and Preaching almoſt undergoes the hardſhip of</hi> Hagar, <hi>to be lookt upon as the Bond-woman of the Synagogue, and to be turned out of doors:</hi> That they are <hi>ſetting up the honour of one Perſon, and make the Offices of the Church a matter of State and Dignity, more than Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; conſulting their Eaſe and Honour; judging of the Service of God rather by the practice of the Church, when it came to enjoy Eaſe and Plenty, than by the ways and practices of the firſt and pureſt Apoſtolical times: when the Apoſtles, who were beſt able to judge of their own Duty, looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as moſt concern'd in the Preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> (pag. 333.) by which every one knows what you mean; and that you hereby deſign'd to diſgrace the <hi>daily Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Common-Prayers</hi> of our Church; even to turn them out of it; and at that time, when the Authority of the Kingdom (the miraculous Providence of God making way) concurr'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:101155:27"/>
to their reſtauration; like another <hi>Sanballat,</hi> uſing this common high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way inſinuation thereunto, taken from the ſcandalous Rabble, and worſt of our Enemies. And I have been credibly told, That your ſelf did neither Subſcribe nor Read the Service-Book, till that fatal (as ſome call it) St. <hi>Bartholomew;</hi> and you had otherwiſe been deprived of your <hi>Rectory</hi> of <hi>Sutton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſubject you reaſſume in your <hi>Preface,</hi> ſpending a great part of it with a vehement zeal and ardency in defence of <hi>Libertiniſm;</hi> ſo far, as, That no Church Laws ought to be enjoyned as <hi>Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> but thoſe which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath himſelf given us, or, <hi>thoſe that were immediately directed by the guidance of the Spirit of God. Thoſe things</hi> (you ſay) <hi>are ſufficient for that, which are laid down as the neceſſary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſtianity by our Lord and Saviour in his Word, which are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for Salvation. Would there be ever the leſs Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in a Church, if diverſity were allow'd as to practices ſuppoſed</hi> indifferent? <hi>Yea, there would be ſo much the more as there was a mutual forbearance and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as to ſuch things. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church is an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Love and Affection,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are juſtly called <hi>Damnable</hi> by the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and condemned (with <hi>certain pernicious Books) in their Judgment and Decree paſt in Convocation,</hi> July 21. 1683. <hi>as deſtructive to the ſacred Perſons of Princes, their State and Government, and of Humane Society;</hi> and preſented to his late <hi>Majeſty,</hi> of bleſſed Memory, <hi>July</hi> 24. in the <hi>Twenty firſt</hi> and <hi>Twenty ſecond Propoſitions;</hi> and in theſe words, <hi>viz. It is not lawful for Superiors to impoſe any thing in the Worſhip of God that is not Antecedently neceſſary. The Duty of not offending a weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is inconſiſtent with all humane authority, of making Laws concerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things.</hi> But yet you endeavour to make them good from theſe ſeveral Topicks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Deſign and Example of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> whoſe buſineſs <hi>was, to eaſe Men of their former Burthens, and not to lay on more. The Duties he required were no other but ſuch as were neceſſary. He that came to take away the unſupportable Yoke of the Jewiſh Ceremonies, certainly did never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to gall the Necks of his Diſciples with another inſtead of it. What Charter hath Chriſt given the Church, to bind Men up to more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath done? Or, to exclude thoſe from his Society, who may be admitted into Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From the Example of his Apoſtles; <hi>who do not warrant any ſuch rigorous Impoſitions either. We never read of the Apoſtles making Laws, but of things ſuppoſed neceſſary. When the Council of the Apoſtles met at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>for deciding a caſe that diſturbed the Churches Peace, we ſee they would lay on no other burthen beſides the neceſſary things,</hi> Acts xv. 29. <hi>It was not enough for them, that the things would be neceſſary, when they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101155:27"/>
them; but they looked on an antecedent neceſſity either abſolute or for the preſent ſtate, which was the only ground of their impoſing thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon the</hi> Gentile <hi>Chriſtians. All that the Apoſtles required as to theſe, was a mutual forbearance, and condeſcenſion towards each other in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. You parallel the Laws of our Church, as to indifferencies, and in limiting of them in particular practices, with thoſe Impoſitions of <hi>Rome, as to the Rule of Faith,</hi> and her other <hi>Idolatrous Superſtitious Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. From the Example of the <hi>Primitive Church; which</hi> (you ſay) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves greater imitation by us in nothing more, than in that admirable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, moderation and condeſcenſion which was uſed in it, towards all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it. It was never thought by her worth the while to make any ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laws for Rites and Cuſtoms, that had no other original but Tradition; much leſs to ſuſpend Men her Communion for not obſerving them.</hi> And you inſtance in that objected caſe related by <hi>Sozomen, (Eccl. Hiſt.</hi> l. 7. c. 19. and the ſame is in <hi>Socrates, Hiſt.</hi> l. 5. c. 22.) which every one rallies our Church withal, that can but read the Hiſtorian in Engliſh, or the Libellers of our Church, who in their Pamphlets repreſent her to them, as you do here, to her diſadvantage. It is granted that theſe Churches there mentioned, as <hi>Antioch, Rome, Aegypt, Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> did differ from one another in divers Cuſtoms and Rites; as in <hi>times of Faſting, manner of Meats,</hi> &amp;c. and therein they were not to judge or condemn one another: But you muſt prove that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Rome,</hi> &amp;c. did allow different Rites in their particular Churches; which you cannot do from that place, the contrary is evident there. For, the examples you bring, <hi>That there were divers Rites and Customs, not only in different Churches, but in different places belonging to the ſame Church, and many Cities and Villages in</hi> Aegypt, <hi>differ'd from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church of</hi> Alexandria, prove nothing againſt us. For the <hi>Dioceſs of Aegypt</hi> (as the <hi>Notitia</hi> informs us) had abundance of <hi>Provinces</hi> in it, which had alſo their diſtinct <hi>Metropolitans</hi> and Laws. And <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> (however it might be the <hi>Patriarchical See,</hi> or Mother Church, in relation to them all) was otherwiſe but the firſt Church in one of theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> called <hi>Provincia Aegypti primae,</hi> and ſo a Siſter Church. And <hi>Socrates</hi> farther tells us, That the People of <hi>Thebais</hi> (which is a diſtinct Province alſo of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with its <hi>Metropolitan</hi>) had this different cuſtom from <hi>Alexandria:</hi> And thoſe whom he calls <hi>Neighbours to the</hi> Alexandrians, were in all likelihood another of the <hi>Aegyptian Provinces. Socrates</hi> plainly ſevers them one from another as diſtinct Provinces. All this will be fully exemplified in the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the days of St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> where there were ſeveral <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> with their particular <hi>Biſhops,</hi> whoſe <hi>Primate</hi> he was: But yet every one of thoſe Biſhops had his diſtinct and appropriated Power in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101155:28"/>
his Province. <hi>Neque quiſquam noſtrum ſe Epiſcopum Epiſcoporum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituit. — Quando habet omnis Epiſcopus libertatis ſuae arbitrium proprium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vid. Concil. Carthag. de haeret. baptizand. inter opera Cypriani.</hi> But then, tho' the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had this Power in his own <hi>Province,</hi> to eſtabliſh what <hi>Rites</hi> and ways of Worſhip he judged moſt convenient; yet no Man but your ſelf, or with your deſign, ever hence aſſerted, that each Village or Pariſh Church in the Province, had the ſame Power, or might erect their own mode of Worſhip alſo. I remember imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the <hi>Conference</hi> at the <hi>Savoy</hi> (which was the firſt Summer, upon his late <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s happy return) there came forth a large ſtitch'd <hi>Quarto,</hi> containing the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> Reaſons and Argumentations againſt the re-eſtabliſhment of our Church; it was without a name, but drawn up, as was ſuppoſed, by <hi>Richard Baxter:</hi> And one of his principal heads which he much inſiſted on, was this paſſage in <hi>Sozomen</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> I fear me you had been dabling here; and ſo tranſcribed it for authentique Hiſtory in their ſenſe of it; a thing in thoſe days too uſual with you. And yet St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> with St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> are brought for farther inſtances of this ſuppoſed <hi>admirable Temper in the Primitive Church, and for freely allowing Liberty to Diſſenters from them in matters of Liberty and Practice;</hi> whom you hope our Church of <hi>England (then upon its re-eſtabliſhment)</hi> will follow in <hi>not impoſing Rites; but leaving Men to be won by the obſerving the true order and decency of Churches, whereby thoſe that act upon a true principle of Chriſtian ingenuity, may be ſooner drawn to a compliance in all lawful things, than by force and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Impoſitions;</hi> notwithſtanding thoſe Teſtimonies of St. <hi>Auſtin, &amp;c.</hi> ſpeak as if they had foreſeen the caſe of our Church, and had deſign'd ſo to determine on her ſide, as to ſtop the mouths of all gain-ſayers. For as they allow of different Rites (in things not unlawful) in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Churches, ſo they as ſtrictly require compliance from all the Members of a Church, with the Rites of its own Church; and they are ſo far from allowing any difference as to theſe matters in one and the ſame particular Church, that in caſe any of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers travel to another Church, they are directed to comply with the lawful <hi>Rites</hi> of that Church, although different from the <hi>Rites</hi> of that Church of which they more particularly own themſelves, that ſo no diviſion might be made. And this I take to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the very way of arguing; and the occaſion, and the deſign of thoſe Teſtimonies do ſo palpably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, that nothing but a Man, who had Sacrificed his Judgment either to his Paſſion or the humour of a Party, would have ſet himſelf to pervert them thus quite contrary to their meaning.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:101155:28"/>5. You tell us, That <hi>thoſe who firſt brake this Order in the Church, were</hi> Arians, Donatiſts <hi>and</hi> Circumcellians, <hi>whilſt the true Church was known by its Priſtine Moderation, and Sweetneſs of Deportment towards all its Members.</hi> So that the worſt of Hereticks, the worſt of Chriſtians, and the worſt of Men, (and ſuch were theſe three Sects) are the only perſons to be found in all <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that reſtrained Men, by Laws, from being of what Religion they pleaſed, and reduced them to an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> in the Worſhip of God. Or thus, That <hi>Church-Laws,</hi> laying limits to Mens practice in God's Service, are from the ſame riſe, as Uſurpation, Rebellion, Murder, Burglary, Schiſm, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, Church-robbing, Spoiling Men of their Poſſeſſions, all manner of Profanation of Holy Things and Perſons, forcing Mankind to <hi>Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodoxies</hi> in Religion, Immorality in Manners, and Rebellion in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Perjury, Hypocriſie, Deceit; for theſe were the conſtant Practices of thoſe three Sects, and the Laws and Rules that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by in their pretended <hi>Reformations,</hi> and attempts to reduce, what they called, Chriſtianity: And the <hi>Canons, Rubricks,</hi> and Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of our Church (and the whole Chriſtian World beſide) take away and invade Chriſtian <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> equally as thoſe worſt of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> did. I do not now wonder that you have ſhew'd ſo much diſlike to that part of Dr. <hi>Parker</hi>'s Book of <hi>Religion and Loyalty,</hi> where he makes it appear, That <hi>Euſebius</hi> and his followers, that Spawn of the <hi>Arian Hereſie,</hi> were for <hi>Comprehenſion;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oppoſed the Holy <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and the firſt Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe limiting the Chriſtian profeſſion of Faith to <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> and denounced the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of the Church againſt all ſuch as ſhould violate them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly, You magnifie the <hi>indulgence</hi> which was granted at <hi>Breda</hi> by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. as the effect of his <hi>excellent Prudence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration;</hi> when it was purely his misfortune and neceſſity that engaged him to it, occaſion'd by a ſort of Men in this Nation, no ways behind the <hi>Arians, Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Circumcellians,</hi> thoſe Cut-throats of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and therefore the Wiſdom of the Nation (to whom he at firſt referr'd it) immediately adviſed him againſt its farther eſtabliſhment, and it was re-called. Neither was he the firſt Chriſtian <hi>Prince</hi> that complyed with the like neceſſity; the very <hi>Gentile</hi> Worſhip having been <hi>indulged</hi> for ſome time, and for the ſame reaſons, and by good <hi>Emperors,</hi> by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelf, as is evident in Church-Story. And your ſelf would deride your own inference, if another did make it; <hi>viz.</hi> That therefore the Heathen Worſhip ought not afterward to have been ſilenced; and that the ſucceeding Imperial Laws, to that purpoſe, were unwarrantable Innovations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101155:29"/>And ſo you have my account of this your <hi>unlucky Book:</hi> I own, that it was not my firſt deſign to make it thus publick; and I had not done it now, had I not been provoked to it, in part, by your indirect and unſcholar-like dealings with me, in that, (inſtead of an anſwer to matter of Fact and Argument,) you have only <hi>Libelled</hi> me to a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Biſhop</hi> of our Church, in a Two-Penny Paper; to which is tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and therein your farther diſingenuity appears) one of your Four-Penny <hi>Sermons,</hi> that it may with the greater diſpatch and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be poſted over the Kingdom, and I be certainly condemned by <hi>Bell, Book</hi> and <hi>Candle,</hi> of thoſe (even your <hi>Female</hi> Admirers) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whoſe hands the main Controverſie never came, nor, indeed, are they competent judges of it: And whether my <hi>ſtile</hi> or your uſage of me in this affair, be more <hi>Barbarous,</hi> I appeal to the common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. You have out-done Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s rudeneſs, who only cried me about <hi>London</hi> Streets, tho' theſe Artifices never take long, and a due diſcovery only breaks their Necks more ſurely: But I was moſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, in that you have not only defamed me, but vindicated this Book, to that eminent <hi>Biſhop,</hi> your <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> as ſerviceable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and deſigned to that end by you. If this be to ſerve our Church, by uſing and urging all ſorts of Arguments, whereby her <hi>Form of Government</hi> by <hi>Biſhops</hi> is repreſented without any bottom and foundation as from Chriſt, cheap and contemptible; their Offices rendred ſuſpicious to the Civil <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and as his Supplanter; their abetters and maintainers ſlighted and ridicul'd; their manner of Worſhip vilified, and deſcribed as ſet up in oppoſition to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Example; their power wholly taken from them, and a Liberty granted to all Pretenders: In a word, Where your chief deſign ſeems to be levelled againſt them, then you have done it in the <hi>Irenicum;</hi> and yet theſe are not all the <hi>Heterodoxies,</hi> and dangerous Doctrines therein contained. It is a <hi>Hotch-potch</hi> or mixture of all Religions; in which ſomething is to be found for the defence of each <hi>Sect,</hi> that hath infeſted us ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and only the Church of <hi>England</hi> is conſtantly oppoſed: I may ſafely ſay, It has perverted many Thouſands, (ſhould I add Millions I did not exceed,) which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have been true Sons and Adherers to her <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> It is the very center of <hi>Puritaniſm,</hi> and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of <hi>Fanatick madneſs,</hi> rendring us guilty of the ſame Schiſm in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is charged with in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that you have in ſome particular paſſages of this Book, declared your ſelf in a different manner than is here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. I anſwer, My buſineſs is not to reconcile every contradiction

I have obſerved your own rule in the like caſe, by which you give your judgment of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who had ſome little flights againſt Truth, and his conſtant opinion, as you have here for it, and againſt yours. (pag. 278.) <q>I would fain know whether a Man's Judgment muſt be taken from occaſional and incidental Paſſages, or from deſigned and ſet Diſcourſes; which is as much as to ask, Whether the lively repreſentation of a Man by Picture may beſt be taken, when in haſt of other buſineſs he paſſeth by us, giving only a glance of his Countenance; or when he purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deſignedly ſits in order to that end, that his Countenance may be truly repreſented?</q> And I muſt hence conclude, that you are as much for thoſe particular points, becauſe giving a glance of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance towards them, as paſſing by, as you have concluded St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to have been for the <hi>Divine Right of Epiſcopacy,</hi> which you then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed him not to be.</p>

latter will give you I know not, but ſcarce any good Man will forgive you the fixing ſo bold a Slander on the former: Nor can your Friends of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> take it well at your hands, that you ſhould attempt to perſwade the World, they brought that Glorious <hi>Martyr</hi> to the Block for being a <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> But the aſſerting the ſame thing over again, you think to be proof enough againſt me, eſpecially if it be eek'd out with ſome ill Language.</p>
            <p>I have had this account of Dr. <hi>Pocklington,</hi> a noted Divine of our Church, in the days of the bleſſed <hi>Martyr</hi> juſt now mentioned; That when he was accuſed and cenſured for delivering in a Sermon (probably, that which he Preached before the <hi>Lord Biſhop of</hi> Lincoln, <hi>at his Lordſhip's Viſitation at</hi> Ampthill <hi>in the County of</hi> Bedford, Aug. 17. 1635. <hi>called Sunday no Sabbath,</hi>) ſome Tenents concerning the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> which were thought to be <hi>Heterodox,</hi> (or rather thought convenient that they ſhould be declared ſo, by a Faction which then prevailed, by reaſon of their compliance with the <hi>Puritan</hi> Party;) his Penance was to make a <hi>Recantation,</hi> which he began thus, <hi>If</hi> Canto <hi>be to Sing,</hi> Recanto <hi>is to Sing again,</hi> and ſo went on with a defence of his <hi>Sermon.</hi> If you deſigned your <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> for the ſame purpoſe, that he was enjoin'd to Preach a <hi>Second Sermon,</hi> your performance is the ſame, or a <hi>Singing the Second Part to the ſame Tune;</hi> it being only a Self-juſtification: And for the better ſeeting it off, I am brought for the foil, whom, by the <hi>embelliſhments of your Wit and Oratory,</hi> you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly repreſented as a Knave and a Fool, Malicious and Ignorant; and this is the whole ſubject of it. But, notwithſtanding, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the Epiſtle was written in a great Paſſion, and indeed it is moſtly a diſcharge of your Choler upon me: and deſigning to be as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to you as I can, I have ſet my ſelf to a particular examination of your other Writings, which were made publick ſince the date of your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> to the time that my Book of <hi>Church-Power</hi> was put into the <hi>Preſs,</hi> (which was <hi>September</hi> 1683.) when your thoughts may be ſuppoſed more calm, and your Meditations leſs diſturbed. (For if ſince you have made any notable <hi>retractations,</hi> I am not in the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in them.) But alas! little of amends is to be found here either; in ſome inſtances, you have offered nothing like a ſatisfaction; in others, nothing plenary, and as might be expected form a perſon of your Learning, Dignities, and Quality in the <hi>Church.</hi> I do therefore thus farther charge you, and produce your ſelf for my alone evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you have made no ſatisfaction for the Manuſcript which you have Printed; and thereby done ſo much injury to our Church in general, in the days of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101155:30"/>
our moſt eminent Doctors in particular. In all your works there occurs not one word that mentions it; much leſs that either by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſorrow or ſatisfaction, makes any thing like an amends for it: And tho' it may be diſputed, whether any one of theſe alone are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; yet, where there is no one of them, to be ſure is no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Nay you are ſo far from any remorſe, or ſenſe of the black guilt that is upon you, for this great and groundleſs Scandal, that you have to your utmoſt, made it more publick and authoritative: For, it was by you delivered to Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> as he owns in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and Printed, by your order, in his <hi>Collection of Records,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Doctor Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> and with the approbation of <hi>both Houſes of Parliament;</hi> and this was Eighteen Years after the firſt publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it in your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> (a ſufficient time for Second Thoughts;) and your continued fixed Judgment is thereby notoriouſly made known to all Men. And ſo, this vagrant, illegitimate Script, without any date of its own, as to time; without any original, to make it a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; all your account of it being only this, <hi>That by the hand of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it happily came to your hands,</hi> (which account is very ſcandalous, Providence being the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> for every Impoſtor,) is placed in the <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation of the Church of England,</hi> with the time and year when the Conference was held, and hath the Character (as well it may upon your terms) of an <hi>Authentique Writing;</hi> and hereby Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> is equally diſhonoured as an <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> with your ſelf as a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> of the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt; that your own reputation, as a <hi>Divine of the Church of England,</hi> muſt be ſhrewdly called in queſtion hereby, is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, becauſe, this <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> upon your alone authority, and with the Character of <hi>ſtupendae eruditionis theologum,</hi> is made uſe of by the moſt rigid and rude of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Party, to prove, That our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> did not believe a <hi>Biſhop</hi> and a <hi>Presbyter</hi> to be two diſtinct <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> but that it is in the power, and at the pleaſure of the <hi>Prince</hi> to Govern by <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or by <hi>Presbyters</hi> without them: And they farther hereupon aſſert, That our own <hi>Divines</hi> were generally of the ſame Opinion, during the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> tho' <hi>Bancroft</hi> and <hi>Laud</hi> have ſince maintained the contrary, and aſſerted <hi>Biſhops</hi> to be by Divine Right, and a diſtinct Order. This is to be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi>'s <hi>Apologia pro ejectis in Anglia miniſtris, vulgò Non-conformiſtis;</hi> but a particular of this paſſage in it, is given by the <hi>Reverend Dean</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Durell,</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſiae Anglicanae Vindiciae,</hi> cap. 28. I might add, becauſe the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> Party is hereby much confirmed and ſtrengthned. Now, can any Man think that a true Son of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (who by his relation to her alone, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101155:31"/>
to believe, that the Power of the <hi>Prince</hi> is quite another thing from the Power of the <hi>Church,</hi> as alſo the Power of a Biſhop, from the Power of a Presbyter) would willingly, and under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as theſe, have given this great advantage to the Adverſary, that you ſo manifeſtly have done by reprinting this <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> and with the approbation of the <hi>two Houſes of Parliament;</hi> and not add one Note in the <hi>Margent;</hi> diſowning the evil conſequents have been drawn from it? Is it not rather a yielding to them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the objection, giving new Strength and Sinews unto it? Or, is it not a thankful acceptance of the honour that was done you by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the Quotation? And I fear you were over-tickled with that higher <hi>Eulogy,</hi> and wonderful commendation they beſtow'd upon you. Sure I am, you could not have ſerved them, and their deſign, more advantageouſly. I muſt confeſs I was ſtartled at the firſt reading of it.</p>
            <p>Again, the reputation of Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> is equally at the Stake alſo, as an <hi>Hiſtorian.</hi> The grounds and reaſons produced by the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> in his forementioned <hi>Vindiciae,</hi> cap. 28. upon which he ſuſpects the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> to be a fraud, and not the writings and determinations of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and thoſe others, whoſe names it bears, ſeems to me very conſiderable; they amount indeed to a demonſtration; his words are theſe, <hi>Nam quifactum,</hi> &amp;c. <q>For how comes it to paſs that theſe things, in that <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> were altogether unknown to <hi>John Fox,</hi> that moſt diligent compiler of the Acts and Monuments of <hi>Cranmer</hi> and the other <hi>Martyrs,</hi> (a Man over much addicted to the Faction of the Puritans,) "and the other moſt diligent writers of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Whence is it that <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and other ancienter Puritans heard nothing of them? And they are to be believed to have heard nothing, ſince they have made no mention of them. How happens it that no one Hiſtoriographer of that time, hath remembred ſo memorable a thing, as was that Conference of ſo many illuſtrious Men, concerning the affairs of ſo great moment? For, (if we may believe the <hi>Manuſcript</hi>) there was enquiry of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the principal heads of Religion, as of the Rights of the higher Powers about holy things; and thoſe moſt eminent Men, and learned Prelates, did there diſpute of them all.</q> I'll add, how came Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> not to find it out? He was a Man well acquainted with Engliſh Story; and the concurrence of <hi>Arch-Biſhop Cranmer,</hi> and ſo many of our firſt <hi>Reformers,</hi> in his Scheme of Government, (which I have ſhew'd to be the ſame with this in the <hi>Manuſcript,</hi>) would have been very pleaſing unto him: He did not hate our Church and Divines ſo much, but that he was glad, on each occaſion, to ſerve himſelf of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101155:31"/>
them, and did ſo. Surely a wiſe Man would have conſider'd theſe things, ſome way or other; the <hi>Doctor</hi> wanted <hi>full thoughts</hi> and a <hi>thorough conſideration</hi> here, to be ſure; and it ſhall go for part of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, for that he hath ſo much deſpiſed them in others: Surely no one would have gone to the Preſs without laying theſe things together, and their conſequences, but he who looks upon himſelf as the very <hi>Pillar of Truth,</hi> which will bear out any inſcription it is entituled withal, and his own Authority, as ſufficient to make credible what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhall think fit to recommend to Mankind. And this his Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Precarious, Self-authoritative way of writing Hiſtory, and Record-making, is ſo much the more culpable in the Doctor, becauſe he hath particularly blamed <hi>Peter Heylin</hi> (a Man much better and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter than himſelf) upon the like (as he ſuppoſed) occaſion. His words in his <hi>Preface</hi> (after many ſeverer Animadverſions upon him) are theſe; <hi>In one thing he is not to be excuſed, that he never vouched any Authority for what he writ, which is not to be forgiven any, who write of Tranſactions beyond their own time, and deliver new things not known before; ſo that upon what grounds he wrote the greateſt part of his Book we can only conjecture:</hi> For ſurely it is much ſafer, and a great deal leſs diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to produce no Authority, but leave Men to their own <hi>conjectures,</hi> than to produce and vouch that Authority which is falſe, and hath no bottom at all, except that of one ſingle <hi>Doctor;</hi> or, in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, a <hi>Sceptical injudicious Youth,</hi> who vouches <hi>Providence</hi> for it; by which he can only mean, that the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> came to his hands imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Heaven; for, no humane hand reacht it unto him: All <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> all Men of what ſort ſoever, that can be conceived to have been concerned in things relating that way, being altogether ſilent about it. And I ſhall hereafter no more believe him, in whatever it is that he delivers, (unleſs I ſee the originals with mine own Eyes, or have them vouched by a better Authority than his own,) than I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the late Dialogue between him and the <hi>Groaning-Board.</hi> The old malicious Fable of the <hi>Nag's-Head-Ordination,</hi> (by which the Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Rome</hi> defamed our Church one way, as you have by your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript</hi> another) carries much more likelihood of truth and <hi>credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in it. For, our Biſhops and Divines had a meeting at the <hi>Nag's-Head-Tavern;</hi> but it was only to Dine there, when the confirmation performed at <hi>Bow</hi> Church, was over: But there is no ſhew or ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of ſo much as a meeting of theſe Church-men that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, of whom your counterfeit Manuſcript gives a Relation. For my part, I cannot imagine which way he and you could have more effectually contrived, whereby to caſt dirt in the Face of our <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> You have moſt certainly given two of our preſent and principal
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101155:32"/>
Adverſaries thoſe advantages their Predeceſſors never were aware of; and the beſt ſervices you can propoſe in the Printing of it, will not countervail the certain and moſt notorious damage it has brought to our Church. I'll here tell what I ſometime ſince met with in <hi>Livy,</hi> l. 40. c. 30. <q>In the ground of <hi>Petilius,</hi> the Scribe, were found two Cheſts, the one had a bundle in it containing ſeven Books in Latin, <hi>de jure Pontificio,</hi> or relating to Religious matters; they were peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſeveral, and, at laſt, read to the <hi>Senators,</hi> who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned them to the Fire, (and they were accordingly burnt before the People,) becauſe in many things tending to the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Religion.</q> The Wiſdom of that Government knew full well the ill conſequences of admitting ſuch looſer Papers into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with their received Worſhip, ſuppoſed at firſt to have come from Heaven, and made afterwards the Law of the Kingdom. And if every muſty <hi>Script,</hi> really moth-eaten by time, or diſguiſed by deſign (as were the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Shoon and Bread) be received as an <hi>Authentique Manuſcript, reach'd forth by the hand of Providence,</hi> the World will never want abuſes, and <hi>providential</hi> Proviſions of that nature.</p>
            <p>But admit the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> is really ſuch as you repreſent it to be; and thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> did actually meet at ſuch a Conference, and make thoſe determinations; yet, you and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> are not diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſtand accuſed of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs,</hi> and underhand Dealing in the Printing and Publiſhing of it; and that upon theſe two accounts: 1. For altering the general method of it. 2. For leaving out Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s <hi>Subſcription</hi> to Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s Opinion concerning <hi>Church-Power,</hi> by which he retracted his firſt Erroneous Judgment. The firſt is granted by Dr. <hi>Burnet (viz.</hi> that the method is altered) in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble to the <hi>Manuſcript;</hi> the other is urged againſt you by Dr. <hi>Durell</hi> in his <hi>Vindiciae, cap.</hi> 28. whoſe Narrative of the matter of Fact I only repeated; accuſing you but of the ſame <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs,</hi> he before had told the World you were guilty of, upon his own knowledge and peruſal of the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> in your preſence. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> takes a great deal of pains to vindicate himſelf and you herein, in his ſeveral Letters; but he does it with ſuch an imbitter'd Spirit, ſo great rudeneſs of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſuch ſtruglings and convulſions within himſelf, even appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent contradictions, that he muſt be concluded upon ſight to have the worſer cauſe; and, withal, a load of guilt upon him. I thought to have left him to the due chaſtiſement he hath already received from a judicious hand, in two Letters; but having a freſh provocation in the laſt Paragraph of your <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> I look upon my ſelf as engaged to ſay ſomething more. You ſeem to boaſt e're the harneſs is put of, and to triumph before the Victory, in theſe words
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101155:32"/>
following: <hi>As to his accuſation about Archbiſhop</hi> Cranmer<hi>'s Manuſcript, I think he hath heard enough of that already, and he owes me a Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation upon his own terms, for charging me with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs therein, for the Scandal and Offence hath been very publick.</hi> Pray how comes it that I <hi>owe a Publick Recantation</hi> more than Dr. <hi>Durell?</hi> Or in what have I charged you, or given ſuch <hi>Publick Scandal and Offence,</hi> which he had not done before? I only produced his Words, and alledged his Authority. It ſeems very ſtrange that you ſhould not be ſenſible of this heavy <hi>Charge, Scandal</hi> and <hi>Offence</hi> till now; or, if ſenſible, that it was not removed. Dr. <hi>Durell</hi> wrote his <hi>Vindiciae</hi> at leaſt Fourteen Years ſince, and yet your ſtory is told without naming him; and all the <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>Madneſs,</hi> and <hi>rude way of Diſputing with his Brethren</hi> is laid at my Door. I confeſs I did not treat you with thoſe moſt ample magnificent Titles that he did; and if that omiſſion be the inſtance of my <hi>rude way,</hi> you might have ſaid ſo. But there are reaſons why you did not accoſt him: A <hi>Vicar</hi> in the Country is trod upon with more eaſe and acceptance, than a <hi>Dean,</hi> who is your equal: And I find a general prejudice againſt me, becauſe I have not a <hi>Stall</hi> in a <hi>Cathedral.</hi> And that you may not think that I ſpeak this at random, I muſt here tell you, That there is a <hi>Dean of a Cathedral</hi> in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of your acquaintance, that has openly and paſſionately exclaimed againſt me, without any conſideration of the matter of my <hi>Book,</hi> as guilty of unpardonable audaciouſneſs; and farther ſaid, That, <hi>all the Deans in</hi> England <hi>were concerned in it:</hi> So that it is with me not altogether unlike what the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Salzbourgh</hi> ſaid of <hi>Luther;</hi> And let a <hi>Dean</hi> ſay what he will, it is an unſufferable thing that he ſhould be told of it by a Country <hi>Vicar:</hi> But I am inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe your chief reaſon to be, that you were ſo Opinionated, as to preſume your ſelf really to be the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all other, whether <hi>Deans</hi> or <hi>Vicars,</hi> to be but as <hi>Fleas,</hi> when coming out againſt you.</p>
            <p>But after all, What is this <hi>Publickly, Scandalous,</hi> and <hi>Offenſive charge,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Windſor</hi> and I have conſpired againſt you in? The thing is matter of Fact, which may eaſily be adjuſted, if allowed a fair Iſſue. Your Accuſation is this; That when you Printed <hi>Archbiſhop Cranmer</hi>'s <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> firſt, in your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> and then in Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s <hi>Church-Hiſtory;</hi> you dealt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfully,</hi> becauſe, that notwithſtanding the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> had retracted his firſt Opinion concerning Church-Power, wherein he was Erroneous, and ſubſcribed to Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi>'s Opinion with his own Hand, ſetting <hi>Th. Cantuarienſis</hi> below the Doctors, and blotting out his firſt <hi>ſubſcription.</hi> You have wholly omitted all this, without giving an account of it to the World. And does
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101155:33"/>
not Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> acknowledge it in his Letter to me upon that occaſion, and in his two other Letters? For he there argues to this effect; That tho' he left out <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Subſcription that was under <hi>Leighton</hi>'s, concerning <hi>Church-Power;</hi> yet he placed it with <hi>Leighton</hi>'s at the end of the laſt queſtion, concerning <hi>Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction;</hi> which was in effect the ſame, as if he had placed it under that of <hi>Church-Power;</hi> his diſign in putting <hi>Th. Cantuarienſis</hi> to the <hi>laſt Article,</hi> being, not that it ſhould be interpreted, as if he Subſcribed only that one Article with Dr. <hi>Leighton;</hi> but, as his Subſcription to all the queſtions preceeding; and accordingly <hi>he ſet down on the Margent of the laſt queſtion, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Cranmer<hi>'s Subſcription; [Theſe are the Subſcriptions that are at the end of every Man's Paper:]</hi> And hereupon, in thoſe his clamorous Lines, he does not accuſe me, in that I ſaid that he left out that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Subſcription</hi> and <hi>Recantation</hi> of <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s, without giving any account of it; but that I <hi>Accuſed him uncharitably and Slander'd him falſely,</hi> in that I ſaid, That he concealed and denied <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and Recantation,</hi> becauſe he had omitted it there: Whereas, it was ſet down in <hi>Durell</hi>'s <hi>own Senſe,</hi> (tho' with <hi>ſome variation in the Words</hi>) under the queſtion of <hi>Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction.</hi> Hence he proceeds, as upon a Victory, inſulting, and calumniating; he bids me <hi>go read the Epiſtles and Goſpels more carefully, and learn to practice the Rules of Juſtice and Chriſtian Charity, not to ſpeak of Prudence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcretion,</hi> at this rate exerciſing his Talent of Evil-ſpeaking upon me.</p>
            <p>But, the worthy Doctor, cooling by degrees, and brought to his ſecond thoughts, by a due Correction, in <hi>two Letters,</hi> for this Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance <hi>(the advices of his Friend prevailing more with him than his own heats,)</hi> changes his Note, and tells a new Story; <hi>viz.</hi> That, 'tis true, a <hi>Man's Subſcription belongs to every line in his Letter; but by this ſame Art of reaſoning,</hi> it will not therefore follow, that, one <hi>Subſcription</hi> at the end of <hi>Seventeen Queſtions of different Subjects, in ſundry particulars, oppoſing one another to contradictions, can be his aſſenting to all the Opinions contained in them;</hi> hereupon the Scene is altered, and another Plot comes upon the Stage; he owns, That <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s name was Subſcribed under <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s in the <hi>queſtion of Church-Power;</hi> (tho' left out by himſelf and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi>) but not by way of <hi>Recantation; but all that he can make of the Subſcription is, that he might, according to a Rule that ſome Miniſters of State have obſerved, ſet his hand to thoſe Papers, as a mark that they might not be altered; and as to</hi> Leighton<hi>'s Paper, there may be this particular reaſon for it, that</hi> Leighton's <hi>not being in the Commiſſion,</hi> Cranmer, <hi>who it ſeems order'd him to write anſwers to thoſe Queries, might have ſet his hand to his Paper, as a warrant to him for having writ them.</hi> And is not this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101155:33"/>
fine jugling? Or rather, it is no jugling at all, but downright bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced impudence: And the Doctor is reſolved to ſay any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than give up his bad Cauſe. You may aſſure your ſelf, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe <hi>conjectures</hi> (for he profeſſes them to be no more) or rather dreams, may be received, as of force enough to put <hi>an end to the whole matter,</hi> (whereupon he has reſolved <hi>not to write one word more on this Subject,</hi>) by thoſe of your own Party, who, as ſo many <hi>abſorpt Stars,</hi> move only in your <hi>Vortex;</hi> yet, there will be found ſome conſidering Men in the Kingdom, that will not be caught with ſuch baits; <hi>who do not ſhelter themſelves under the</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Appendex</hi> to your <hi>Irenicum</hi> is the Treatiſe, to which, as I have been informed, you ſtill refer all thoſe who require better ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from you as to thoſe points. And, to be ſure, this is your <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> out of which, you ſay, I have taken all my <hi>conſiderable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove the Church a diſtinct Society;</hi> for there is none <hi>publiſhed by you above twenty years ſince,</hi> except this, that treats of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And it may be expected to find ſome amends here, if ever you have made, or deſign'd, any becauſe it ſeems to be added to the <hi>Irenicum,</hi> on purpoſe to rectifie what appear'd amiſs, or to ſupply ſomething wanting in it. Now he that duly and ſeriouſly conſiders it, will find the whole performance to conſiſt of theſe two Heads: And that, you there aſſert, the <hi>Church</hi> a diſtinct Society from the <hi>State,</hi> always to ſubſiſt by a Charter from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the outward viſible profeſſion of Chriſtianity; tho' the Powers and Laws of the World are againſt it; and this in oppoſition to the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who ſays, That the precepts of the Goſpel are not <hi>Law,</hi> till enacted by Civil Authority: And your arguments are common but good, by which you prove it; which he that treats on the ſame point, cannot well omit, all agreeing ſo far, that really own Chriſtianity. Again, you farther aſſert, That our Saviour, by a ſpecial Charter alſo, hath enabled ſome of this Society
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101155:34"/>
to govern; commanding all the Members of it to obey, and which comes to the very point now in hand. But this Power, which is fixed by you on the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church, is alſo limited to the <hi>Power of Excommunication,</hi> as the argument of it (anſwering to the Title) ſpeaks; but you leave all other Acts and Offices of the Church, where you had placed them before in the main Treatiſe; <hi>i. e.</hi> (excepting the Offices of Teaching and Adminiſtring the Sacraments) in the hands of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> So that, as I ſaid above, the Power over Sacred Things is annexed entirely to the <hi>Civil Power:</hi> And the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors are only to adminiſter in the Offices of them, without any Power, whereby to puniſh offenders againſt the <hi>Laws of Religion.</hi> And this is with Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> To <hi>defend the fundamental Rights of the Church;</hi> or his <hi>aſſerting the juſt Power of the Magiſtrate in Eccleſiaſticks as well as Civils, in oppoſition to the extravagances of thoſe, who ſcrewed up the Church-Power to ſo high a peg, that it was thought to make perpetual diſcord with the Commonwealth; and others, that melted down all Spiritual Power into the Civil State, and diſſolved the Church into the Commonwealth;</hi> as you tell us, in the entrance to the Treatiſe. And ſo, tho' the diſcourſe, as to the main, is Sound and <hi>Orthodox;</hi> yet in the preſent deſign of it, it is a colluſion and <hi>fallacy</hi> put upon the Reader. It ſeems of the ſame nature with that lye of <hi>Ananias</hi> (and it is to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) whereby, as he kept back part of that poſſeſſion, which he ſold for the uſe of the Church, and ſaid it was the whole; ſo have you kept back part of the <hi>Power of the Church,</hi> and ſaid you have given in the whole. And the reply that <hi>Peter</hi> gave to <hi>Ananias,</hi> may not unfitly be returned to you alſo: <hi>Why haſt thou conceived this thing in thine Heart? Thou haſt not lyed unto Men, but unto God.</hi> Acts 5.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>The next Treatiſe that I have made enquiry into, for the finding out your after judgment in theſe points, is, Your Vindication of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Laud;</hi> in which I find little amends for theſe your Erroneous <hi>Irenicum</hi> Doctrines; but, rather, an evident confirmation of many of them, if not doing worſe.

without any Specifications) for the proving of which, you take a great deal of pains to inform us, <hi>what things are neceſſary to the Salvation of Men, as ſuch, or conſidered in their ſingle and private Capacities;</hi> or (in your own words and ſenſe) <hi>out of the Church Society, or Eccleſiaſtical Communion:</hi> And having concluded, <hi>That believing in Chriſt and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him; or an hearty aſſent to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious walking according to the precepts of it, are that Faith and Duty indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to the Salvation of Private Perſons.</hi> You then add, That, <hi>that which we call the Catholick Church;</hi> or, as you farther ſpeak, <hi>the being of a Church, ſuppoſes this antecedent belief in Chriſtians,</hi> as to theſe things neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>it being only a combination of Men</hi> together, upon that belief, and for the <hi>performance of thoſe Acts of Worſhip which are ſuitable thereto.</hi> You go on, and ſay, <hi>whatever Church owns theſe things,</hi> (where by a <hi>Church</hi> you can only mean thoſe which are not a <hi>Church,</hi> but out of the combination, and in their private capacities, or ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to it; but you are to look to your terms, not I,) <hi>which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently neceſſary to the being of a Church, cannot ſo long ceaſe to be a true Church</hi> (where the contradiction recurs, and you ought thus to have expreſſed it; That Men in their private and perſonal capacities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving theſe neceſſary things, cannot ceaſe to be true Chriſtians, tho' out of that Church and Combination; for ſuch is your meaning) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it retains the foundation of the being of the Catholick Church.</hi> Again, the diſtinction that you uſe is equally unintelligible, and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <hi>viz. Here we muſt diſtinguiſh thoſe things in the Catholique Church, which give it its being, from thoſe things which are the proper acts of it, as the Catholique Church: As to this latter, the ſolemn Worſhip of God in the way preſcribed by him is neceſſary; in order to which there muſt be ſuppoſed lawful Officers ſet in the Church, Sacraments duely Adminiſtred; but theſe I ſay, are rather the exerciſe of the Catholique Church, than that which gives it its being, which is the belief of that Religion whereon its ſubſiſtence and unity depends; and as long as a Church retains this, it keeps its being, tho' the integrity and perfection of it depend upon the due exerciſe of all Acts of Communion in it.</hi> How theſe things can be ſaid to be in the Catholick Church, and give it its being, as Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whoſe being you told us, a little before, ſuppoſed them, and to which they are antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, you, not I, are to make out when you can: Or how the exerciſe of Church Communion is the perfection of Faith and good Works. I have always learnt the contrary; <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith and good Works are the perfection of Church Communion, in attendance to the ordinances. You ſay farther, That <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Catholique Church depends upon the agreement of it, in making the Foundations of its being</hi> (that is, Believing in Chriſt and walking in him) <hi>to be the grounds of its
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101155:35"/>
Communion: From whence it neceſſarily follows, that whatſoever Church impoſeth the belief of other things, as neceſſary Articles of Faith</hi> (and not only agreements for the Churches Peace) <hi>which were not ſo ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently neceſſary to the being of the Catholick Church, doth, as much as in it lies, break the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of it, and thoſe Churches, who deſire to preſerve its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, are bound thereby not to have Communion with it, ſo long as it doth ſo.</hi> To which you add, <hi>That nothing ought to be impoſed as a neceſſary Article of Faith to be believed by all, but what may be evidently propounded to all perſons, as a thing which God did require the explicite belief of.</hi> As alſo, <hi>That nothing ought to be required as a neceſſary Article of Faith, but what hath been believed, and received for ſuch, by the Catholick Church of all Ages.</hi> All which, whoſo pleaſe may read more at large, from Page 48. to Page 57. I having only digeſted it, and put in as narrow a room, and with as much perſpecuity as I could: For, ſince the rule is, <hi>He that gives muſt take,</hi> I venture to be ſo bold as to tell you, It is there all along very roughly and incoherently, both as to matter and form, even contradictorily put together by you; tho' not altogether ſo unintelligibly, but that it is plain and evident, that you have quite overthrown the <hi>Jeſuite:</hi> For, as I ſaid before, If all <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> neceſſary to Salvation, be antecedent to the being of the <hi>Church,</hi> and its Governors, the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of it; they cannot then, how great ſoever that Power is, wherewith they are enſtated by Chriſt, be conceived to have created any one of them: But the main doubt is, How you will anſwer for thoſe many and palpable injuries our common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſuffers thereby, and reſcue your ſelf from the perverſer concluſions, which are the immediate reſult of your Arguing. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That a Man may be a Chriſtian, and not a Church Member.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That true Faith and Obedience may be attained out of the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the being of the Church is not neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Church is a ſubſequent Combination for Acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Church Officers are not of the eſſence of the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the exerciſe of the Communion of the Catholick Church adds only to her perfection. And by conſequence,</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the Church doth not ceaſe to be a Church without it, any other ways, than a Man ceaſeth to be a Man without a Hand or a Foot.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the Union of the Catholick Church depends upon its agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Foundation; or in that aſſent and belief which is antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneous unto it. Or thus,</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:101155:36"/>9. That Schiſm, which is a breach of the Churches Union, does not relate to Church Officers, in their Church <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Canons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. That all neceſſary Articles of Faith are antecedent to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; and conſequently, that Article of the Holy Catholick Church in our Creed.</p>
            <p n="11">11. That the being of a Miniſtry is not the object of a Chriſtian Man's Faith, ſo as neceſſarily to be believed by him.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That, that Church which impoſeth it as ſuch, as much as in it lies, breaks the Unity of the Church: And other Churches are not bound to have Communion with it, ſo long as it does ſo.</p>
            <p n="13">13. That the Church Explanations of Faith, are not a neceſſary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith.</p>
            <p n="14">14. That the Church ought not to explicate any one Article of Faith, or deliver and recommend it in any other words, for the aſſent of Faith, than thoſe we find in Scripture.</p>
            <p n="15">15. That when any ſuch Explication of Faith is made, it muſt be made evident to all perſons, that God did command that Explication, and require the explicite belief of it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. That the determinations of Faith made by any Council, but more particularly, by the Four firſt General Councils, are an Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Impoſition upon Chriſtendom; becauſe, there is no Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's will, that thoſe higher Articles ſhould be ſo explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and impoſed on Chriſtians, as in thoſe Councils they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
            <p n="17">17. That <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and the <hi>Homoouſians</hi> were the impoſers upon the Church of God, in that great Controverſie betwixt them and the <hi>Arians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. That, Univerſality as to perſons, time and place is not that which makes a neceſſary Article of Faith; becauſe, all neceſſary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith are ſuppoſed by you to have been antecedent to the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> as to perſons, time and place; and conſequently, you muſt either ſay, That the Article of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> is no neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Article, or object of Faith; or thoſe conditions are not neceſſary to the making ſuch.</p>
            <p n="19">19. That the placing ſome Books of the New Teſtament in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which were not once there, for ſome time of the Church, is an impoſition.</p>
            <p n="20">20. That all the Laws and Definitions of the Church, concerning the higheſt Articles of Faith, oblige no otherwiſe, than when concerning an ordinary Ceremony.</p>
            <p n="21">21. That there is no more guilt in denying the Doctrine of <hi>one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> than in not ſtanding up when the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed is ſaid, ſuppoſing that a <hi>Rubrick</hi> hath injoyned it.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:101155:36"/>22. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath put the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creeds into her Church ſervice, and enjoined them for an inſtance of her Confeſſion of Faith, when ſhe does not require that we believe them; or if ſhe do, ſhe goes beyond her Authority.</p>
            <p n="23">23. That ſhe greatly erres, not only in impoſing the <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Creed</hi> for our Confeſſion of Faith, which, either ſhe does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to believe; or if ſhe does, we ought not to believe; but turns out the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Creed, upon certain days, to bring that in its room.</p>
            <p n="24">24. That her breach of truſt, together with the affront, is much more unpardonable; becauſe the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed is commanded to be ſaid in the room of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> on the higheſt days, and in the higheſt Offices of our Chriſtian Service and Worſhip; <hi>viz.</hi> The great <hi>Festivals</hi> of the Year, as <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-day, <hi>Eaſter</hi>-day, <hi>Aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>-day, <hi>Whitſunday, Trinity-Sunday;</hi> when a more particular, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Confeſſion of our Faith, with the greateſt Zeal and Ardency, Courage and Reſolution, is implied to be a Chriſtian Man's Duty.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, That, herein and hereby, you give ſupport and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the many Sectaries that are among us; as, <hi>Anabaptiſts, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Independents, Quakers;</hi> who, upon theſe very grounds that you have laid down to oppoſe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> quite fling off the Miniſtry, or Church of God, as altogether uſeleſs as to its publick Acts of Worſhip, or Decrees and Declarations: Or elſe, they, to be ſure, look upon it as that which cannot be ſuppoſed abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation. And, indeed, the conſequence comes una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable upon you; for, if that which is neceſſary to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Men, be antecedent to Church Society, or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Communion, and attainable without it, you will find very little left, whereby to perſwade Men to ſubmit to that Society.</p>
            <p>It is yielded, that Believers, in ſome ſenſe, are antecedent to the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Church is a Society veſted by God with <hi>Power</hi> to oblige the whole; becauſe, this <hi>Power</hi> cannot be received, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as true, and not an impoſture, but upon a preſumption of the Scriptures being God's revealed Word, approved as ſuch by Signs and Wonders, to the Senſe and Reaſon of all Men; there being no other way, whereby the truth of any Power pretending from Heaven, can be tried, and vouched: That, by which, a thing is tried and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, muſt be before that which is tried by it. We muſt firſt believe that God hath erected ſuch a <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>incorporation,</hi> ere we can be ſatisfied, that it is our duty and intereſt to enter into it.

            <p>You are ſo ingenuous in your <hi>Irenicum (Pag.</hi> 32.) as to caution the Reader, That all the Rules and Practicks you there draw from the <hi>Laws of Nature,</hi> were but the fictions of your own Brain, and a Scheme of Nothings. Your words are theſe, <hi>A State of Nature I look upon as an Imaginary State; for it is confeſſed by the great aſſerters of it, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Parents and Children, cannot be conceived in a State of natural Liberty, becauſe Children ſo ſoon as Born are actually under the Power and Authority of their Parents:</hi> And it is ſome ingagement in order to the obtaining his pardon, for the impertinence and extravagances in that nature, he was to meet with. I think the ſame caution would have been equally ſeaſonable here alſo; for your <hi>State of Nature</hi> is not more <hi>Imaginary</hi> than your <hi>State of Grace:</hi> And it will be as difficult to meet with a Chriſtian out of the Church, and independent to his <hi>Spiritual Father</hi> and Governor, as to find a Child without a Father, or in no tye of Duty to him. Chriſtianity is a Body by God's inſtitution and command, and not purely by after voluntary Acts of Men; it can neither ſuppoſe nor leave Men at Liberty; no Man lays limits to the Power and Mercy of God; thoſe that have <hi>no Law,</hi> he may ſave with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>the Law;</hi> and thoſe Chriſtians whoſe unhappy circumſtances, and harder neceſſity, have caſt them into that <hi>dry Land where no Water is,</hi> or out of Church Privileges, and it was not in their choice to obviate and prevent it, will be ſaved by the Mercy of God. But then no Man ought to enlarge that, which God, by his Revealed Will, hath bound up and limited; or, (where his Church, in her Offices and Adminiſtrations, is in actual being and ſetled) give to any the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and aſſurance of Salvation out of it, and take upon them the confidence to preſcribe <hi>what things are neceſſary to the Salvation of Men, as ſuch, or conſidered in their ſingle and private capacities,</hi> or out of the <hi>Church Society and Eccleſiaſtical Communion.</hi>

But reading on, I met with Reaſons that made me believe it might be the Genuine Product of your
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101155:38"/>
own Brain; you having farther declared your ſelf with the like Liberty, in theſe following particulars: As,</p>
            <p>That the Church hath no <hi>declarative Power in matters of Faith;</hi> or, ſuppoſing any Article obſcure to us, or inverted and involved by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; ſo that the matter of it hath not been explicitly acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Ages of the Church anteceeding, when the preſent Church gives the true meaning of it, according to the tradition of Faith, evidencing thereby the Senſe of the Article; or, which is the ſame, the ſenſe of Scripture, on which the Article is founded, and engages the aſſent of all Chriſtians thereunto: That, hereby, ſhe creates a new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, (<hi>pag.</hi> 75, 945.) as if there were no mean betwixt the Power of the ſingle Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who reſolves all her actings into her own immediate Authority, and the true Power of the Catholick Church of God, which determines antecedent truths, that were (tho' leſs known, or miſinterpreted) from <hi>the beginning;</hi> and, when the reaſon of her decree is not from her own Authority, but the <hi>Tradition of Faith,</hi> delivering the ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt down unto us.</p>
            <p>That, the <hi>Church repreſenting,</hi> and the <hi>Church diffuſive</hi> are all one; nothing can make the <hi>Church teaching</hi> and <hi>repreſentative,</hi> but the <hi>belief of what is neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> (Pag. 86, 87.) I thought a diſtant Power, by Ordination, had conſtituted the Paſtors of the Church. You go on at the ſame confuſed rate, <hi>Pag.</hi> 251, 252. I'll only write out your words at large, and let the Reader judge of them; <hi>That which being ſuppoſed a Church is, and being diſtroyed, it ceaſeth to be, is the formal conſtitution of it; but thus it is as to the Church, The belief of Fundamentals makes it a Church, and the not believing them makes it ceaſe to be a Chriſtian Church: I ſpeak of an eſſential, not an organical Church: And I know not who thoſe perſons are, who out of thoſe places</hi> (Luk. 10.16. Matth. 28.19, 20. Joh. 14.16.) <hi>do infer the perpetuity of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical Church; nor if they did, doth it thence follow, they muſt ſuppoſe an infallible aſſiſtance, beyond an eſſential,</hi> ('tis ſtrange that nothing ſhould be found betwixt theſe two in your own ſenſe of them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute Paſtors of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own ſending) <hi>to make it an organical Church; for I cannot imagine what neceſſity can be ſuppoſed of infallibility, in order to that which may be ſufficiently conſtituted without it. The perpetuity of the Church, doth rather argue the infallibility of the promiſe, than of the Church. Suppoſing then, that the promiſes, by you inſiſted on, ſhould be ſo far extended as to imply a perpetuity of a Chriſtian Church, what doth that argue but only this, that to make it appear that promiſe is infallibly true, there ſhall always be a Succeſſion of Chriſtians in the World? Suppoſe I grant that the being of a Chriſtian Church doth ſuppoſe the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101155:38"/>
there no aſſiſtance</hi> but what is infallible? <hi>If not, no one can be a Chriſtian without infallibility; for we speak of no other aſſiſtance, but what is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make Men Christians; for what makes them ſuch ſeverally, take them conjunctly, makes them a Church. But if you, beſides what aſſiſtance is requiſite to make Men Chriſtians, do ſuppoſe ſomewhat more to make them a Church, I pray name what it is? And whatever it be, it will not be own'd by ſuch who infer a Perpetuity. But if in order to that, no more be meant (as no more can be meant) than what is neceſſary to make Men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; then infallibility will grow ſo cheap and common,</hi> (I add, and Church-Power and Offices together with it) <hi>it will not be worth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging by you for your Church;</hi> neither will a Miniſtry be worth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging by us either. But this is agreeable enough with the Title you ſtill give the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> in this Treatiſe; and as if he had no other <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> but what is derived from his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and is purely <hi>Secular,</hi> you call him his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> only. I much queſtion, Whether it might not have diſcompoſed the <hi>Calm</hi> that moſt exemplary <hi>Prelate</hi> died in upon the Scaffold at <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> if he could then have been aware that he ſhould have had ſuch a <hi>Vindicator.</hi> I cannot here but repeat it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, tho' it be ſo very Offenſive, How gladly I ſhould ſee the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſed, and our common Chriſtianity not ſtruck at with the ſame blow and hand: Surely the due Power of God's Church might have been vindicated, and <hi>Rome</hi>'s Uſurpations rejected, without this intermingling all as one, both <hi>Prieſt and People,</hi> as you have done here moſt Scandalouſly.</p>
            <p>And at the ſame rate you diſpute alſo againſt the <hi>Monarchical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church,</hi> and an <hi>infallible judge</hi> (Pag. 464.) <hi>becauſe Chriſt no where, that we read of, took care that we ſhould be freed from all kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies; and we no where find ſuch a State of Chriſtian Church deſcribed or promiſed, where Men ſhall be of one mind, (only that peace and brotherly love continue, is all that Chriſtians are bound to,)</hi> and <hi>that every Man have the ſame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Which Arguments conclude as forcibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any other <hi>Government,</hi> even that of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, and his Apoſtles, were they upon Earth again, and in the ſame circumſtances, as when here before. Nay, you have uſed theſe very Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all manner of <hi>Government</hi> in your <hi>Irenicum.</hi> And farther (<hi>Pag.</hi> 172.) you infer, <hi>Becauſe it is not in the Power of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>judicially and authoritatively to determine what Books belong to the Canon of Scripture, and what not:</hi> Therefore, <hi>the Church in this caſe is but a Jury of grand Inqueſt, to ſearch into matters of Fact, and not a Judge upon the Bench, to determine in point of Law:</hi> And thereby take away all judicial Power from the Church, to oblige her Members or Subjects by, for their aſſent and ſubmiſſion to her Acts and Decrees, upon a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:101155:39"/>
due ſearch of matter of Fact, and full evidence of the Truth and Certainty of thoſe Articles, Rules and Canons, enjoin'd and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And thus you particularly affront the Practice of our own <hi>Church;</hi> ſhe having made it <hi>Law,</hi> that only ſuch a certain number of Books of the Old and New Teſtament be <hi>accounted and received as Canonical,</hi> and withal requiring <hi>Subſcription</hi> thereunto (as a judge upon a Bench to be ſure) by all that are admitted by her into holy Orders.</p>
            <p>And as you have before concluded, That whatever Power can be ſuppoſed by Chriſt to be promiſed and derived to his Church, from <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is that which each private Chriſtian partakes of. So again (<hi>Pag.</hi> 516.) you ſay, That whatever Power can be ſuppoſed in a <hi>General Council,</hi> muſt be firſt in the <hi>Church diffuſive,</hi> and from thence be derived to the <hi>Council.</hi> Which in effect is thus, That the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of Chriſtendom (who by right are only to ſit in <hi>Council,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Presbyters</hi> as have ſat and acted there, did it only as their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, and by virtue of their deputation) receive their Power either from the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> or, which is worſe, from the <hi>Laity</hi> or <hi>Believers</hi> in common. The Presbyters, indeed, make the lower Houſe of <hi>Convocation</hi> in our <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but the reaſon of that is from a particular Law in our <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which <hi>imbodies</hi> no <hi>Canons,</hi> giving to them the <hi>Secular</hi> protection, but ſuch as paſs the Votes of all the inferior <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Nation, repreſented by the <hi>Presbyters</hi> that ſit there, as well as the Votes of the upper <hi>Clergy</hi> or <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Such Stuff have you put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet there is worſe; for you add, <hi>The utmoſt then can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in this caſe, is, That the parts of the Church may voluntarily conſent to accept the decrees of ſuch a Council; and by that voluntary act, or by the Supreme Authority enjoining it, ſuch decrees may become Obligatory:</hi> As pure <hi>Irenicum</hi> as any in the World.</p>
            <p>I'll add but one inſtance more, by which it will farther appear, how you run againſt, or at leaſt evade, the true Power of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> veſted in them by Chriſt, for the obliging the whole; and it is that of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which (in proſecution of your foregoing notion) you aſſert (<hi>pag.</hi> 290.) to be a <hi>violation of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which Christians are obliged to, upon the acknowledgment of the truth of Christian Religion, or upon owning Christianity the way to true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;</hi>

And did you really believe, that there is <hi>an advantage on the ſide of Authority, which ought to over-rule the Practice of ſuch, who are the Members of that Church, where the Authority is exerciſed,</hi> (as you ſpeak,) you would alſo be ſo kind to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> as to urge, with more conſtancy, upon them their duty in obeying, as a Private Man, you ought to propoſe nothing leſs unto them. Tho' I cannot ſee why we ſhould leſs doubt of your good will to them and their Cauſe, when you drew up thoſe Terms and Articles of <hi>Toleration;</hi> than of <hi>Coleman</hi>'s kindneſs to the <hi>Papists,</hi> when he drew up his <hi>Declaration</hi> for Diſſolving the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> in order to a <hi>Toleration</hi> alſo: And it will be difficult to determine, which of the two was more preſumptuous. I know what courſe the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> would have taken with a <hi>Private Presbyter,</hi> who, after a full debate in <hi>Council,</hi> ſeconded with a <hi>Church Sanction,</hi> and confirmed by the <hi>Imperial Conſtitution,</hi> ſhould have dared to have made Propoſals, or draw up Rules and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, and make them publick in oppoſition thereunto: and yet, this was not your firſt attempt of this nature; your good will to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, Latitudinarian</hi> Principles hath all along been manifeſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious. Thoſe many Meetings which you and your <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had, were not ſo private but that ſome took notice of them; where you made Propoſals for altering the Church Government, ſetled and confirmed by all that is ſacred in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> And the reaſon is plain why thoſe Men, afterwards, dealt ſo ſeverely with you, (of which you complain in the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Preface,</hi>) upon that Sermon which was Preached before my <hi>Lord Mayor;</hi> becauſe after your <hi>healing Condeſcenſions</hi> in private, you appear'd a <hi>Revolter and Apoſtate;</hi> and they were to deal with you as one that had broken his Faith. If ſome other had Preached that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101155:41"/>
they might poſſibly have born with him, (he acting according to his principles) when you were not to be endured, <hi>(&amp; tu Brute)</hi> their Friend, with whom they <hi>took ſweet Council together</hi> concerning the <hi>Houſe of God.</hi> I add farther,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in your Treatiſe of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of Separation,</hi> you no where (that I could take notice of) have preſſed Chriſtians to Obedience as they are a <hi>Corporation,</hi> imbodied under Governors and Laws of their own, (which is the original and fundamental Obligation to ſubmiſſion and conformity,) ariſing from the nature of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> erected by the promulgation of the Goſpel, of which Kingdom every true Chriſtian is a Subject. I do not deny but that your performance is competently well done, upon your principles, and ſo far as it reacheth: You have abundantly ſet forth the <hi>reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of our <hi>Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> in the <hi>Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other Rites and Ceremonies,</hi> and urged Obedience thereunto from the deſtructive conſequences, that muſt inevitably follow in that Church or Society of Chriſtians, which retains not an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of Worſhip; and more eſpecially this <hi>reaſonable one,</hi> that we have in our <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But all is left ſtill as matter of Diſpute, like the <hi>Corporation</hi> it ſelf, as Arbitrary, and at the pleaſure of its Subjects, to retain or reject them; and he that ſees not with your Eyes (by your own principles) hath no Obligation for Obedience and <hi>Conformity</hi> to any one <hi>Rubrick, Law</hi> or <hi>Injunction,</hi> therein contained. And it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in your <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> that you <hi>beg pardon,</hi> indeed, <hi>of your Superiors,</hi> for <hi>going beyond your bounds in your projects of accommodation:</hi> But it is not for any one reaſon relating to them, as your Governors; or becauſe you have been injurious thereby to their Power and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> which you, in ſo doing, had inroaded and invaded. But, becauſe (forſooth) the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> would not come up to you, and their <hi>untractableneſs rendred your Project uſeleſs,</hi> admit you had jump'd together, and united in the project, What then? Why you had never begged their pardon: And it was ſucceſs, not deſign, was wanting, by your own confeſſion. The very caſe of <hi>Coleman.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, is not this a delicate Apology for your ſelf? After you have <hi>Mountebank'd</hi> and <hi>Quack'd</hi> for full Five and twenty Years, and find your Patient worſe and worſe under your hands, and that you are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>work a Cure,</hi> you then return him to the Church and her <hi>Laws of Diſcipline,</hi> for a juſt Habit and Temperature. The College of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,</hi> I am ſure, would not think themſelves beholden to ſuch an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſon which you give for that great tenderneſs you ſhew'd to <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> when writing the <hi>Irenicum (Preface</hi> pag. 84.) or that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101155:41"/>
plenary <hi>Toleration</hi> all Men ought to have, is, becauſe the <hi>Laws were not then Eſtabliſhed;</hi> and return it upon them, that they <hi>have not very well requited you for the tenderneſs and pity</hi> you had for them, and the <hi>concernment you expreſſed to have brought them in upon eaſier terms than were ſince required:</hi> But pray, was not the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> the ſame under the <hi>Rump Parliament</hi> and <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> as it now is? And what had you to do to enlarge or limit her terms then, more than now? It was then a <hi>Pragmatick</hi> Encroachment, and ſo it is now. I do not believe that <hi>Biſhop</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> from whom, you ſay, you received, in thoſe days, <hi>Epiſcopal Orders,</hi> gave you any ſuch Directions: I am ſure you received no ſuch Authority at your <hi>Ordination</hi> by him. When the <hi>Empire</hi> frowns upon the Church, or <hi>Anarchy</hi> relaxates the due Exerciſe of her <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and every good Chriſtian, are to conſider what is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be practiſed: And ſome directions are given in the caſe, by the Author of the <hi>Diſcourſe of Church-Power,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. But none are to think themſelves acquitted of their Obedience to <hi>Church-Laws,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Suſpenſion, or <hi>Interregnum;</hi> much leſs, that they are Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to preſcribe eaſier terms, and acquit the firſt Obligation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this Anſwer and Practice is no ways agreeing with him, who hath told us, That <hi>the Church is a peculiar Society, in its own Nature, diſtinct from the Commonwealth, ſubſiſting by Powers of its own, apart from it; ſubjected in the hands of its own Officers, by a Charter from Chriſt, never to be divorced, but remaining formally in the Church, after its being incorporated into the Commonwealth.</hi> For how can this Church be diſeſtabliſhed by any confuſions in the State, or loſe this Power? All that can be ſaid in your behalf is this, (and I am reſolved to ſay what is to be ſaid for you) That according to this reaſon, you do not believe the Power that is enſtated on the <hi>Officers</hi> in this <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,</hi> for governing the whole, to extend to <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining their <hi>Liberties</hi> in theſe caſes; or that the Church is a Body ſubſiſting by her own <hi>Laws;</hi> but aſſert the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hand;</hi> which being at that time ſo much leſſened in this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> you thereby (amongſt the reſt of the <hi>Arbitrary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>) became at liberty to act apart, and did ſo; conceiving that no Law, as a <hi>Church-man,</hi> or in <hi>Epiſcopal Orders,</hi> did enjoin you the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And hence it's plain, why in the <hi>Appendix to the Irenicum</hi> (where we have alſo the above-mentioned <hi>Definition</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi>) you ſay, That you have ſlit the Hair betwixt the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> adjuſting to each that Power which belongs to them, when you name only <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> as her <hi>Rites.</hi> And hence it is as evident alſo, as any thing can be, That I did not <hi>Steal</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:101155:42"/>
my <hi>conſiderable Arguments</hi> out of this <hi>Appendix,</hi> which I uſed in behalf of that other inſtance of the <hi>Power of the Church, (viz.</hi> to govern her own Body by her own Laws) the aſſerting whereof, makes up the Body of my Diſcourſe. And it farther appears, That, that was not one of thoſe points, concerning which, you <hi>ſaw reaſon to alter your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Twenty Years time.</hi> As in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that <hi>Preface (pag.</hi> 53.) upon the clamors of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> by reaſon of your Sermon againſt <hi>Separation;</hi> and that you Preached not for <hi>Abatements and Alterations, and taking away Ceremonies and Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leaving them full Liberty to do what they pleaſed, by which you might have gained their good Opinion, and have been thought to have Preach'd a very ſeaſonable Sermon:</hi> Or, in plain Engliſh, becauſe you did not make Propoſals for <hi>Toleration,</hi> as you did a little after. To all this you ſuggeſt, <hi>ſuppoſing my private Opinion were never ſo much for ſome Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be made, that might tend to ſtrengthen and unite Protestants, and were conſiſtent with our Nations ſetlement; had it been ſeaſonable to have ſpoken of the alteration of Laws before Magiſtrates and Judges, who are tied up to the Laws in being?</hi> What the Power of <hi>Magiſtrates and Judges</hi> is, relating to <hi>Church-Laws,</hi> I have ſhew'd at large elſewhere; and that, according to the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> when Chriſtian, and the <hi>Statute</hi> Book of our Kingdom ſince the <hi>Reformation:</hi> And I do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Plea to be juſt and good. Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> always were, and ſtill are, Preſervers and Executors of <hi>Church-Laws;</hi> the Church owes her ſupport in a great meaſure unto them. And it is impious as well as unſeaſonable for a private Man, but much more for a Man in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> to make Propoſals for <hi>Nullities</hi> and <hi>Repeals</hi> of thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Enfranchiſements,</hi> which the Religious favour of the <hi>Prince</hi> hath granted <hi>God's Church;</hi> and the Zeal and Vigilance of good <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> take care to preſerve entire and ſerviceable unto her. But, yet, this is not all the guilt that is contracted, or undecency that is committed by ſuch attempts: There is a Church-Power, which you have defined to be diſtinct from the State, and <hi>remaining in the Church, after its Incorporation into the Commonwealth:</hi> And no other reaſon can be given, why your doing the ſame before theſe <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> had not been alike unſeaſonable; or why you pleaded not the equal regard which you ought to have to them alſo; only that you in reality are ſtill of your <hi>Irenicum</hi> judgment; <hi>viz.</hi> That the other <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> are <hi>the Church,</hi> and all Power to make <hi>Church-Laws,</hi> or execute them, relating to outward decency and order, is inveſted in them; and that there is no <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> enſtated by <hi>Chriſt</hi> on his Officers. You, who could tell your Story, and defame me to your <hi>Biſhop</hi> (whom
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101155:42"/>
I honour as one, that is veſted with the utmoſt of Power, that our Saviour was pleaſed to have continued in his Church till his coming again; and do owe an Obedience in ſpecial unto him, and all that are of that Sacred and Superior Order in God's Church) in your <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> might have conſider'd alſo, that he was your <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> or that <hi>Spiritual Magiſtrate,</hi> to whom you owe a more immediate Subjection; and, in reſpect of whom, an attempt to alter <hi>Eſtabliſh'd Laws,</hi> had been equally <hi>unſeaſonable:</hi> Neither did the abſence of his Perſon at the <hi>Guild-Hall Chapel,</hi> render him leſs awful and tremendous unto you.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When you come to the Diſcourſe it ſelf (<hi>Pag.</hi> 134.) you ſeem, at leaſt, too unwary in your Expreſſion; aſſerting, That if the <hi>whole Nation in Parliament conſent to the paſſing a Law for removal of Paſtors, and putting in of others,</hi> this is ſufficient for the ſatisfaction of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom they are appointed as Paſtors by virtue of that Power, or <hi>for the making them true Paſtors.</hi> I yield, that the right of <hi>Inveſtiture</hi> is originally in the <hi>Secular</hi> hand, and, by conſequence, the right of <hi>deprivation,</hi> upon the breach of thoſe terms on which the Inveſtiture is made. Thus <hi>Abiathar</hi> was removed, and <hi>Zadok</hi> put in his room: But the queſtion is, ſuppoſing <hi>Zadok</hi> had not been of the <hi>Prieſtly Line,</hi> Whether <hi>Solomon</hi>'s placing him in the <hi>High-Prieſt's Chair,</hi> did by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his <hi>Kingly Power</hi> alone, create him <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> and the People were thereupon bound to own and ſubmit to his <hi>Miniſtry?</hi> Or to bring an inſtance nearer home, ſuppoſing an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> appoint a certain Perſon to be <hi>Minister</hi> in ſuch a Pariſh, when he is really no <hi>Miniſter,</hi> becauſe without <hi>Ordination</hi> from a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> Whether, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Law, he is made a true <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and ought to be received as ſuch by that People, to whom, by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> he is ſent? No underſtanding Chriſtian will own him as his Miniſter upon ſuch terms. We have a great inſtance of this nature in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> about Fourteen Years ſince: The <hi>Secular Power</hi> commanded Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to admit into particular Churches, and in the relation of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> certain Men that had no <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Orders, and by conſequence, were not of the <hi>Gospel Prieſthood;</hi> the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and exemplary <hi>Prelate</hi> refuſed for this reaſon, Becauſe the Prince may promote to what temporal Poſſeſſions he pleaſe, but he cannot promote to the <hi>Authority</hi> which is <hi>Spiritual;</hi> as to the former he muſt be ſubmitted to, but not as to the latter. And his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> was a great example of the laſt caſe; for, denying their <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> he was Suſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> and ſuſtained it with a due reſignation; tho' the <hi>Government,</hi> upon ſecond thoughts, reſtored him with greater honour and eſtimation, in which he died. But as to the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate queſtion, and which occaſioned this <hi>Section,</hi> you ought to have
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101155:43"/>
urged, That the <hi>conſent of the People</hi> did not conſtitute a <hi>Miniſter;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it any neceſſary qualification in order to it, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and his Combination pretended: But inſtead of doing this, you reply, That an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> is ſufficient to conſtitute him ſuch, which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours too much of the old Veſſel. I confeſs, the conſequents would be really evil in the Government both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> if he be an Uſurper in a Pariſh, to whom the People do not conſent, the diſorders thereby muſt become intolerable; and the conſequents would be as noxious on the other hand, if the <hi>Parliament</hi> had the Power of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying for it: For, then the Miniſtry will be quite ſwallowed up in the <hi>State,</hi> and every Uſurper (be his Religion what it will) may alter the <hi>Prieſthood;</hi> or, as in the days of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> make <hi>Prieſts</hi> of whom he pleaſe. But thus it fares with your Arguments, and it is their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fault, That they prove too much. You take away <hi>Infallibility</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> at once, in other places, and maintain here the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> to the deſtruction of the <hi>Spiritual.</hi> I'll receive him in <hi>Seculars</hi> whom my <hi>Prince</hi> is pleaſed to ſet over me; but none in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> who hath not an <hi>Authority,</hi> which the <hi>Secular</hi> hand cannot derive unto him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But that which crowns all, is, (<hi>Pag.</hi> 300.) when you <hi>ſcatter thoſe miſts, which ſome pretend to have before their Eyes, that they cannot clearly ſee what we mean by the Church of England;</hi> and tell us, it is ſo called, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was received by the common conſent of the whole Nation in Parliament.</hi> Surely, if now we be not a <hi>Parliament Church,</hi> we never were in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any, nor ever ſhall be. Should any Man ask me what the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is, I would tell him, It is that due <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Authority, Doctrine, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> which are now made Law in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but if that Law ceaſeth to own and proteſt them, I ſhould not thereby think it to become leſs the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For certain, there was a <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> when there was no <hi>Parliaments</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> according to thoſe who carry their <hi>aera</hi> or date to the higheſt pitch: And we ſay, There was the very <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> that now is, and neither <hi>Parliament</hi> nor <hi>Pope</hi> had appeared in our Coaſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, What if the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England</hi> paſs a <hi>Bill of Abjuration</hi> againſt the preſent Church, as they did the other day againſt the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England?</hi> The <hi>Rump Parliament did it.</hi> Why then your definition of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is much at the ſame as <hi>Socrates</hi> defined a Man, <hi>Homo eſt Animal, bipes, implume; A Man is a living Creature, with two Feet and without Feathers. Diogenes</hi>'s Jackdaw was as good a Man, when he had pluckt his Feathers off. The being of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> does not depend upon any ſuch outward advantages, or upon the <hi>Votes of the People,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or out of it. We thankfully own the outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101155:43"/>
ſhe has had, and now enjoys, by <hi>Parliaments;</hi> but we own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, her ſeparate Being abſtracted from them; the <hi>Church of God</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> is antecedent to them all. One while I was willing to think, That this Book was wrote by you at a time, when the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was on Foot, for enlarging the <hi>Privileges of Parliaments,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> by the Men of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and you might think your ſelf engaged to caſt in ſomething; and if ſo, you add that which is very conſiderable, making the Being of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to depend upon their owning and acceptance of it. The Kingdom muſt have <hi>Parliaments once a Year</hi> at leaſt, only for this; for, otherwiſe we may have no <hi>Church once a Year.</hi> But then again, this ſeems not to be the reaſon, becauſe I find you to have been of the ſame Judgment ſome years before; and you reckon up this among the Encroachments and Uſurpations of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> (and ſpoil thereby a good cauſe;) viz. <hi>That</hi> Acts of <hi>Parliament were no certain indications of the Judgment of the Church, or the generality of the People in that time.</hi> (Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtle Apologetical, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 448.) I muſt therefore conclude, that you were ſomewhat diſcompoſed; neither is this the only unwary expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have let fall within the diſtance of one or two Pages: For, you there mix the <hi>Paſtors and People</hi> together, as of the ſame <hi>Church diffuſive.</hi> You ſay farther, That to aſſert <hi>in every Church a conſtitutive regent part, as eſſential to it,</hi> is the ſame as the <hi>Pope's univerſal Paſtorſhip.</hi> And again, That the Acts of the <hi>Convocation</hi> are to be <hi>allow'd and enacted by the King and the three States of the Kingdom:</hi> Flatly againſt the <hi>King's Prerogative,</hi> in making Church-Laws by the <hi>Convocation</hi> alone. As alſo, your term, <hi>National Church,</hi> is as incongruous as any. <hi>National, Congregational, Claſſical,</hi> are <hi>Relatives,</hi> and give life to one another.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It doth not appear why you Reprinted that ſcandalous <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> which ſo immediately oppoſeth all <hi>Church-Power,</hi> in the utmoſt latitude of it, and by the Authority of ſo many of our moſt eminent <hi>Reformers:</hi> Nay farther, with an artifice to conceal Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s <hi>Retraction,</hi> unleſs it be to give all the ſeeming Authority you could to the Doctrines there aſſerted. There is not one Note in the Margent by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that you had then altered your firſt conceptions of it, as Printed in the <hi>Irenicum.</hi> Nay you have own'd and juſtified it in part, in your <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to my Lord of <hi>London;</hi> or if there be any alteration made, it is, leaſt there might be occaſion to ſuſpect that <hi>Cranmer</hi> had deſerted you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And in the laſt place, you have made no ſatisfaction at all to the <hi>Church of God,</hi> for that <hi>Irenicum</hi> Doctrine, which equals the <hi>Presbyter</hi> with the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> There is not any thing like amends for it in all your writings that I have met with. It is true, you often ſpeak of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as the moſt ancient <hi>Government derivable from the Apoſtles:</hi> But you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101155:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have not any where aſſerted it in the number of thoſe <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices Apoſtolical,</hi> which are <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>immutable:</hi> And until you ſay this, all you can ſay beſides is to no purpoſe. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> is, notwithſtanding, at the mercy of your <hi>Prince,</hi> or your <hi>Presbyters,</hi> when their prudence ſees fit to degrade and depoſe him. There is no more Obligation to continue the diſtinct order of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> than that order of <hi>Widows,</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtle to Timothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus (Sir) I have ſhew'd, that you have not made due ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for thoſe errors in your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> concerning the <hi>Power of the Church in general,</hi> and <hi>the conſtitution of our Church in particular;</hi> of which I accuſed you in my Letter, dated <hi>May</hi> 1. 1682. I have alſo ſhew'd more at large the grounds of my Accuſation.
